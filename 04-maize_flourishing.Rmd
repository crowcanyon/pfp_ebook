## Soils and water

### What are soils? {-}

Soil is made of a combination of minerals, organic matter, and sediment. These three ingredients are combined in different amounts and travel long distances around the globe through gravity and the movements of glaciers, water, and wind. **Soils store water and nutrients that plants use to flourish.**

#### How does soil gain water? {-}
Water is delivered to the soil in two ways:

*   **The Earth's water cycle**: precipitation in the form of rain, snow and ice. In the Southwest, the most important weather events that deliver water to the soil are winter snowstorms and summer monsoon rains. 
*   **Water management**: Humans capture and store water from the water cycle and spread it on the soil using irrigation systems. 

This video from [The Monsoon Project](https://themonsoonproject.org/) describes the importance of the North American Monsoon to the Southwest.

#### How does soil lose water? {-}

Soils lose water through a process called **evapotranspiration**. This means that the sun and the wind cause soil to lose moisture through direct evaporation and through plant tissues.

Breaking this term into two parts clarifies this definition:

*   **Transpiration** — plants sweat out and lose water they have received from the soil
*   **Evaporation** — the soil loses water due to the wind and the sun

To slow this process, farmers often use a technique called **mulching**. Mulch is:

*   A material that is spread over a planting area to protect the soil from the effects of the wind and the sun.
*   A layer of insulation that traps moisture and shades the soil, which slows evaporation.
*   Carbon-based materials such as straw or dry grass clippings.

Pueblo farmers, such as the Hopi, use dust and sand as a mulch; they cover the moist soil that holds their seeds with a thick layer of sand and dust. 

#### Why do some farmers apply irrigation water to their soil? {-}

Some farmers irrigate because:

*   They are replacing the water that their plants and soils have lost due to evapotranspiration.
*   Some plants require more water than the environment has to offer; the farmers apply irrigation water to make up for water that does not arrive in the form of rain and snow.

Some modern farmers do not apply irrigation water to their soil: 

*   Hopi farmers who have vast direct-precipitation corn fields.
*   Farmers in the Western states who have large direct-precipitation crop farms.

Many Hopi farmers and other farmers in the Southwest do not use irrigation systems; the keys to their success are understanding weather patterns, caring for their soil, planting drought-resilient seeds, and having faith in natural cycles.

#### How do direct-precipitation farmers decide where to place their gardens and fields? Why is this decision so important? {-}

Choosing the location of a garden is called *site selection*. It is important to direct-precipitation farmers because the chosen site must be able to capture and hold water delivered by the water cycle, making it drought resilient. 

**These are features that Hopi farmers of today look for---and that ancestral Pueblo farmers probably also looked for---when searching for a drought-resilient site.**:

*  **Geography**: Rainfall and snowmelt that drains off of a mesa or cliff will collect and flow into drainages, washes, arroyos, and canyons. Where these features become less narrow and widen into sandy slopes, Pueblo farmers expect water and good soil to collect because it is washed down with the floodwaters. This mouth or opening is also a place where they traditionally built **check dams**---rows of low rock walls to slow down the movement of runoff water.
*   **Garden slope**: North-facing slopes have less direct exposure to sunlight and lower soil temperature, and therefore less water is lost to evaporation.
*   **Indicator plants**: The appearance of certain plants in early spring give information, or *indicate*, to Hopi and other direct-precipitation farmers about the best locations for a garden/field, how deep to plant and how much space to leave between plants. Farmers combine these indications with practice, experience, and knowledge of the land. Some examples of plants that indicate these conditions are:

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>CONDITION</strong>
</td>
<td><strong>INDICATOR PLANT</strong>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Good soil moisture
</td>
<td>Rabbitbrush<br>
Four-wing saltbrush<br>
Mormon tea<br>
Rice grass<br>
Snakeweed
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Deep, well-drained soil
</td>
<td>Rabbitbrush<br>
Oak trees
</td>
</tr>
</table>

*   **Soil moisture depth**: deep, soft soils allow natural reservoirs of water to collect and be held deep in the soil.
*   **Soil color**: darker colors often mean higher amounts of decomposed organic matter and nutrients in the soil. In the Southwest, this means dark red-brown.
*   **Large, open planting area**: the area must be large enough that clumps of seeds can be planted with wide spaces between them (2--3 adult paces/steps or 4--6 feet between clumps.) This spacing allows little soil-moisture reservoirs to be created between clumps, providing long-term moisture. 

**Soil moisture is especially important to maize growth at planting (for germination), at tasseling/silking (for best chances at pollination), and during grain fill (to get ears completely covered with kernels).**

### Drought {-}
**When a normal amount of snow and rain does not arrive, this is called a *drought*.**

#### How do Pueblo farmers respond to drought? {-}

The Hopi use the agricultural knowledge gained through their ancestral direct-precipitation farming practices. They want to ensure their crops will continue to be drought-resilient into the future. To survive drought, direct-precipitation farmers must know a lot about their soil and their seeds. Ancestral Pueblo farmers might have responded to drought by:

*   anticipating the possibility that it could arrive any year and preparing for it by saving seeds from plants that can survive drought. 
*   using the site-selection factors listed above to decide whether or not a site would be drought-resilient. 
*   meeting these site requirements by planting in multiple locations.
*   using clumps of plants, twigs, or brush at the edge of the planting area or placing small upright stone slabs around seedlings as a windbreak to decrease evapotranspiration.
*   covering holes that contain seeds with loose topsoil to act as a *dust mulch*.

#### Do other direct-precipitation farmers use any of these same practices? {-}

Yes, though some farmers emphasize knowing the soil through soil testing:

*   First, farmers learn what is in their soil to determine what kind of soil they have. 
*   Second, farmers find out how much water their soil can hold. If the soil receives more water than it can hold, much of the extra water will drain away. Water that is wasted in this way is called **runoff**; it leads to **erosion**, when soil is carried away by the runoff. 

### Soils in the PFP gardens {-}
Pueblo Farming Project researchers used data from the USDA and local soil analysis to characterize the soils in the gardens on Crow Canyon's campus in southwestern Colorado. The map below displays the soils on Crow Canyon's campus. Click a soil to learn more information about it!

## Heat and sunlight
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

All plants require thermal energy---in the form of heat and sunlight---to perform **photosynthesis** and flourish. Photosynthesis is a process used by plants to make a sugary food that fuels their growth. Plants absorb the energy of the sun through their leaves, combine it with water and carbon dioxide, and make a sugar called glucose. **Fun Fact: The waste product that this process creates is oxygen!** Farmers in ancient times adapted their corn to the amount of heat and sunlight available in the regions in which they lived, and farmers today do the same.

But how much heat does a plant need, and how do we know how much it gets? Plant researchers use a measure of accumulated heat called a **growing degree day (GDD)** to estimate the amount of heat that plants may use for photosynthesis.

The equation for daily GDD for maize is:
$$ GDD=\frac{T_{MAX} + T_{MIN}}{2}-T_{BASE} $$
where $T_{MAX}$ is the maximum daily temperature, $T_{MIN}$ is the minimum daily temperature and $T_{BASE}$ is the temperature below which plant growth ceases, which we take to be 10°C (~50ºF) for maize.

Here we use a series of corrections to the equation typically applied for calculating maize GDD, which down-corrects $T_{MAX}$ and $T_{MIN}$ to an upper threshold ($T_{UT}$, here 30°C or 86ºF) above which corn growth does not appreciably increase, and up-corrects $T_{MAX}$ and $T_{MIN}$ if they fall below $T_{BASE}$ (here 10°C or 50ºF). To summarize:
$$
\text{if} \quad T_{MAX}>T_{UT}, \quad T_{MAX}=T_{UT}\\
\text{if} \quad T_{MIN}>T_{UT}, \quad T_{MIN}=T_{UT}\\
\text{if} \quad T_{MAX}<T_{BASE}, \quad T_{MAX}=T_{BASE}\\
\text{if} \quad T_{MIN}<T_{BASE}, \quad T_{MIN}=T_{BASE}
$$

Growing degree day amounts calculated in Celsius are different from those calculated in Fahrenheit. Growing degree days can be converted from Celsius heat units to Fahrenheit heat units by multiplying by a factor of 1.8. For example, 1000 Celsius GDDs are equal to 1800 Fahrenheit GDDs.


### Weather in Cortez {-}
<div style="text-align: center;">

Plants combine water and nutrients from the soil with heat and energy from the Sun to flourish. Pueblo Farming Project researchers estimated the amount of water and accumulated heat available to the maize in the Pueblo Farming Project gardens using weather data gathered by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as part of the US Historical Climatology Network (USHCN). Temperature and precipitation data from a weather station in Cortez were used to measure the response of the Pueblo Farming Project gardens to local weather; we also installed a weather station on Crow Canyon's campus as well as temperature monitors in each garden. The graphs below show 2009 to 2017 data for the Pueblo Farming Project gardens. The top graph shows minimum and maximum daily temperatures and daily growing degree days, and the lower graph shows daily precipitation events. **These graphs are interactive!** Highlight a region of the graph in order to explore the weather. Hover over a graph to see the recorded weather at the Cortez weather station.
