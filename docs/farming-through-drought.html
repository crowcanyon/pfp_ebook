<li>Learn how past Pueblo farmers might have mitigated the effect of drought on their
crops.</li>
<li>Create an experimental dryland garden.</li>
<li>Explore the mathematics of agricultural labor: time needed for planting annual corn
crops using the Hopi’s <em>so’ya</em> (digging stick) method</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Terms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Annual plant</li>
<li>Perennial plant</li>
<li>Domesticated plant</li>
<li>Wild edible plant</li>
<li>Digging stick/<em>so’ya</em></li>
<li>Plant spacing and depth</li>
<li>Hectare</li>
<li>Check dams</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Materials and Tools</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jars of seeds to be used teaching props:
<ul>
<li>heirloom varieties, purchased from <a href="http://www.nativeseeds.org/">Native Seeds/SEARCH</a> or through their Community Seed Grants program
<ul>
<li>corn</li>
<li>beans or squash</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a variety of wild edible plants that have been an important part of the Hopi
culture, such as portulaca (purslane), amaranth, chenopodium (goosefoot),
cleome (bee plant/wild spinach)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Seeds for planting, chosen from above crop varieties but not taken from prop jars</li>
<li>A cooked or raw tasting sample of one or more of the crop varieties chosen for planting</li>
<li>Several deep and stable bowls for dividing up and holding seed</li>
<li>Digging sticks (called <em>so’ya</em> by the Hopi people): wooden (Greasewood and/or oak), or metal (welded metal bar); 1 per pair of students</li>
<li>A few modern hand trowels, if needed to supplement a lack of digging sticks for each student pair</li>
<li>Planting measurement tools: rulers, tape measure (to be used alongside traditional Pueblo methods: walking paces and handspans)</li>
<li>1 printed copy for each working group adult supervisor of the Handout: Traditional Hopi Planting Techniques (attached)</li>
<li>1 printed copy for each working group of Diagram 1: A planting hole in a Hopi maize field (attached)</li>

<p>Read the following portion of the Hopi creation story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>After their Emergence into the Fourth World, the clans that would one
day comprise the Hopi people approached the Guardian Spirit, Ma’saw, in
the region that is now northwest Arizona and asked his permission to
settle there…. “Whether you can stay here is up to you,” he told them.
Masaw warned the clan people that the life he had to offer them was very
different from what they had before. To show them that life, Ma’saw gave
the people a planting stick (So’ya), a bag of seeds and a gourd of
water. He handed them a small ear of blue corn and told them, “Here is
my life and spirit. This is what I give you.”</em></strong></p>
<p>— <cite>Wall and Masayesva 2004:435–436</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Introduce students to the corn varieties and explore their diversity
in size, color, endosperm texture (use a diagram of a corn kernel at
this time).</p>
<p>Show students the digging stick and gourd and circulate them, along
with the corn seed. Allow students to handle and observe them.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Divide students into small discussion groups of 3 to 5 students and
rearrange their seating so they are sitting in small discussion
circles. Count-off the groups, from 1 to 3, to assign each of them a
discussion question number. Read aloud each of the discussion
questions to the corresponding groups.</li>
<li>Each group should nominate and indicate to the instructor who will
be their “Scribe”: the person who will begin the discussion by
rereading the discussion question to the group, and then record the
group’s answers, to share with the class. Hand out the correct
discussion question sheet and a pen to each scribe.</li>
<li>For a total of approximately 5 minutes, groups should discuss their
discussion question and report back on their ideas.</li>
<li>After about 2 minutes, give the groups a time-check and a reminder:
scribes need to record at least a few complete sentence answers to
share. At this time, scribes should re-read their discussion
question to their group to ensure the discussion is still focused
and relevant.</li>
<li>Come back together as a group. The “scribe” from each group shares
their group’s ideas with the class.</li>
<li>The instructor helps to <em>connect</em> the students’ answers with the
information presented below, to help them draw conclusions from
their group’s ideas.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question #1:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Without direct instructions from the Guardian Spirit, Masaw, how did
the first Hopi farmers learn how to dryland farm in the southwest?</em></strong></p>
<p>Through years of trial and error, agricultural experiments, and
long-term observations, they became experts at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding plant and animal behavior</li>
<li>Knowing soil types and measuring moisture content</li>
<li>Predicting weather patterns</li>
<li>Predicting and directing water runoff</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question #2:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Why is corn, in particular, so important to every aspect of
traditional Hopi life?</em></strong><br />
<em><strong>How is corn and agriculture viewed in our modern culture?</strong> </em></p>
<ul>
<li>Corn farming in a drought prone environment is difficult. Helping
corn plants to survive becomes a metaphor for how people can
survive, as life is often difficult. Dryland corn farming teaches
Hopi people the value of patience, humility, respect and
cooperation.</li>
<li>Hopi and Ancestral Pueblo people grew food for their own survival.
They knew exactly how their food was grown and where it came from.</li>
<li>Modern agriculture has disconnected many modern people from an
awareness of where and how their food is grown or produced. Many
modern people expect their food to be delivered to their towns and
houses, already processed, preserved and packaged.</li>
<li>Many modern farmers view corn as a large scale cash crop; they know
that, to produce most corn today, a large water supply (irrigation),
fertilizers, and machinery are required.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question #3:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>After examining the different kinds of Hopi corn, why do you think
there are so many varieties of traditional corn? What are some of the
threats from GMO corn on Hopi corn?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genes</strong> provide the instructions to build a living thing. If you
change one of the genes, you rewrite the instructions.</li>
<li>Humans have been manipulating the genes of plants for 10,000 years,
without harming ecosystems or humans, in a process called
<strong>breeding</strong>—mixing and matching the characteristics found within
one species of plant. It has resulted in an increase in diversity in
crop plants, benefiting human health and increasing the chance that
communities will survive environmental challenges like drought.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity</strong> is important when growing crops in challenging
environments, such as the Hopi do. The Hopi people have survived on
their land in part because they have bred over 17 different named
varieties of corn, each with special talents for adapting and
overcoming threats like drought, and excelling at essential skills
like long-term storage.</li>
<li><strong>GMO</strong>: this acronym stands for Genetically Modified Organism. They
are created by mixing genes from very different species in order to
meet a need or fix a problem in agriculture such as resisting
disease and pests, surviving frost and drought.</li>
<li>The <strong>difference</strong> between genetically modifying plants and breeding
them:
<ul>
<li><em>Breeding crops</em>: plant species’ genes are changed over
thousands of years</li>
<li><em>Genetically modifying crops</em>: plant species’ genes are changed
when a gene, sometimes from a non-plant species, is inserted
to create a new species that has never before existed on Earth
and arrives almost overnight without evolving alongside its
environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is hard to control or predict the mixing of genes plants. Once
GMOs are involved, unintended consequences can result. The
<strong>impacts</strong> of GMO seed on traditional crops and ecosystems are
being actively studied by agricultural scientists. In the meantime,
the Hopi must protect their corn’s genes from mixing with
genetically modified genes. They must protect the purity of the corn
varieties that are at the center of their culture.</li>

<p><strong>With students remaining seated with their small discussion groups,
survey students’ understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the
questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students,
while steering the discussion to toward the answers listed below the
question.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Introduce students to the term <strong><em>self-sufficiency</em></strong> by writing
it on the whiteboard and reading it aloud. Have students work in
small groups of three or four students to discuss the meaning of
self-sufficiency. Invite each group to share with the class while
guiding the discussion toward the the following definition: <em>A
person or group that is self sufficient is able to provide
themselves with what is necessary with little help from others.
Examples: people living in a remote wilderness; people doing an
expedition into mountain or ocean environments; astronauts in
space.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Ask students the following questions and record their responses on
the whiteboard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>How will humans achieve self sufficiency in the
future? For example, how will we make sure we are able to feed the
human population as it increases and the health of the planet
decreases? </em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Point out that being self sufficient on planet Earth
requires that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>know our history (how we have taken care of ourselves in the past)</li>
<li>carefully craft innovative solutions (how we will take care of
ourselves in the future)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Have students work in groups of three or four to engage in a
discussion about each of the following questions. Present each
question one at a time and allow no more than two minutes of
discussion per question</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Do you live in an isolated place? What would happen if the town
you live in were cut off from receiving food from outside sources?
How many roads lead to your hometown? </em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>What kind of events could (or have in the past) destroyed or
blocked these roads? </em></strong>
Flash floods, mudslides, road construction dynamite, wildfires.</li>
<li><strong><em>An important aspect of self sufficiency is food. How does your
town stock the shelves of the grocery stores?</em></strong>
Food is delivered by transport trucks. Towns like Cortez could quickly
become isolated from receiving food and materials from outside
sources.</li>
<li><strong><em>What does it mean to have “food security”? </em></strong>
A community has “food security” when safe, nutritious food is
available without people or food having to travel great distances.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Students return to working with their small discussion groups. Outline
the final activity:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Each group will work as a team to make Space Travel Self-Sufficiency
Plan based on the following hypothetical scenario (read aloud):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Healthy human life on Earth is no longer possible due to
environmental damage. All humans will leave in fleets of spacecraft
where they plan to live for 50 human generations or 1000 years. Each
spaceship has a population of people that must act as a community. Each
community is named after their ship. The first ship to leave will be
“Discovery One”. It will establish the “Discovery One” community. Each
community must decide what what is essential to take with them from
among the objects and technologies that currently exist.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Each student group will work together as a spacecraft community for
15 minutes. Distribute to each a piece of chart paper and a marker.
During this time, the instructor aids the groups by being a
timekeeper. They must accomplish the following tasks to prepare for
their escape from Earth:
<ul>
<li>Decide on a name for their ship/community (1 minute)</li>
<li>Decide which community member will be: (2 minutes)
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>“The Scribe”: a person with good handwriting and drawing
skills and will draw, write and speak for the group, reading
their plan aloud at the end.</li>
<li>“The Checker”: a person who asks good questions and can
focus the discussion on the most important questions about
survival.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Being guided by The Scribe and The Checker, the groups draw a large,
basic outline of a spaceship that takes up most of the chart paper.
The scribe fills the outline with words that describe items or
technologies they want to bring. (5 minutes)</p></li>
<li>At the halfway point in the groups’ work time (approximately 8
minutes into group work time), briefly regroup as a class, and give
the students the following clarifications:
<ul>
<li>6th grade: encourage students to focus on items that will create
systems that resemble healthy ecosystems. Remind all groups
that they cannot include any technology or inventions that
have yet to be invented.</li>
<li>7th &amp; 8th grade: Review the concept that the water cycle is a
closed system. Inform students that the items they bring
should account for this and other closed systems, like
trash/compost/waste, in their spacecraft. Remind all groups
that they cannot include any technology or inventions that
have yet to be invented.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Students resume planning and make changes to their spacecraft to account
for these ideas. (approximately 7 minutes).</p>
<p><strong>Closing Circle</strong></p>
<p>Invite each group to present their plan of self-sufficiency to the
class. Have any of the groups made the connection between their
spacecraft and the actual planet Earth we live on? Our spaceship is
called Planet Earth. Read the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>We are already living on a spacecraft; the Earth is spinning through
space holding human communities. We are separated from space by a thin
layer of atmosphere; the distance from the surface of the planet to
outer space is barely 60 miles. Earth is the only planet we know of that
sustains human life, despite searching space for 60 years.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explain to students that many ancient cultures throughout the world have
created agricultural practices that were sustainable and
self-sufficient. Point out that over the next couple of weeks students
will be learning about ancestral Pueblo people, their farming practices,
and how these practices can inform our own sustainable relationship to
the land.</p>
<p>Engage students in a brief discussion to address the following
questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>What does sustainability mean to you? Do the Hopi/Ancestral Pueblo
people meet your ideas of sustainability? Students explain their
opinions. Survey the students for their understanding of the following
quote:</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Indigenous education is really a ten thousand year strategic plan.”</strong></p>
<p>— <cite>Gregory Cajete</cite></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Introduce students to the corn varieties and explore their diversity
in size, color, endosperm texture (use a diagram of a corn kernel at
this time).</p>
<p>Show students the digging stick and gourd and circulate them, along
with the corn seed. Allow students to handle and observe them.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Divide students into small discussion groups of 3 to 5 students and
rearrange their seating so they are sitting in small discussion
circles. Count-off the groups, from 1 to 3, to assign each of them a
discussion question number. Read aloud each of the discussion
questions to the corresponding groups.</li>
<li>Each group should nominate and indicate to the instructor who will
be their “Scribe”: the person who will begin the discussion by
rereading the discussion question to the group, and then record the
group’s answers, to share with the class. Hand out the correct
discussion question sheet and a pen to each scribe.</li>
<li>For a total of approximately 5 minutes, groups should discuss their
discussion question and report back on their ideas.</li>
<li>After about 2 minutes, give the groups a time-check and a reminder:
scribes need to record at least a few complete sentence answers to
share. At this time, scribes should re-read their discussion
question to their group to ensure the discussion is still focused
and relevant.</li>
<li>Come back together as a group. The “scribe” from each group shares
their group’s ideas with the class.</li>
<li>The instructor helps to <em>connect</em> the students’ answers with the
information presented below, to help them draw conclusions from
their group’s ideas.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question #1:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Without direct instructions from the Guardian Spirit, Masaw, how did
the first Hopi farmers learn how to dryland farm in the southwest?</em></strong></p>
<p>Through years of trial and error, agricultural experiments, and
long-term observations, they became experts at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding plant and animal behavior</li>
<li>Knowing soil types and measuring moisture content</li>
<li>Predicting weather patterns</li>
<li>Predicting and directing water runoff</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question #2:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Why is corn, in particular, so important to every aspect of
traditional Hopi life?</em></strong><br />
<em><strong>How is corn and agriculture viewed in our modern culture?</strong> </em></p>
<ul>
<li>Corn farming in a drought prone environment is difficult. Helping
corn plants to survive becomes a metaphor for how people can
survive, as life is often difficult. Dryland corn farming teaches
Hopi people the value of patience, humility, respect and
cooperation.</li>
<li>Hopi and Ancestral Pueblo people grew food for their own survival.
They knew exactly how their food was grown and where it came from.</li>
<li>Modern agriculture has disconnected many modern people from an
awareness of where and how their food is grown or produced. Many
modern people expect their food to be delivered to their towns and
houses, already processed, preserved and packaged.</li>
<li>Many modern farmers view corn as a large scale cash crop; they know
that, to produce most corn today, a large water supply (irrigation),
fertilizers, and machinery are required.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question #3:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>After examining the different kinds of Hopi corn, why do you think
there are so many varieties of traditional corn? What are some of the
threats from GMO corn on Hopi corn?</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Genes</strong> provide the instructions to build a living thing. If you
change one of the genes, you rewrite the instructions.</li>
<li>Humans have been manipulating the genes of plants for 10,000 years,
without harming ecosystems or humans, in a process called
<strong>breeding</strong>—mixing and matching the characteristics found within
one species of plant. It has resulted in an increase in diversity in
crop plants, benefiting human health and increasing the chance that
communities will survive environmental challenges like drought.</li>
<li><strong>Diversity</strong> is important when growing crops in challenging
environments, such as the Hopi do. The Hopi people have survived on
their land in part because they have bred over 17 different named
varieties of corn, each with special talents for adapting and
overcoming threats like drought, and excelling at essential skills
like long-term storage.</li>
<li><strong>GMO</strong>: this acronym stands for Genetically Modified Organism. They
are created by mixing genes from very different species in order to
meet a need or fix a problem in agriculture such as resisting
disease and pests, surviving frost and drought.</li>
<li>The <strong>difference</strong> between genetically modifying plants and breeding
them:
<ul>
<li><em>Breeding crops</em>: plant species’ genes are changed over
thousands of years</li>
<li><em>Genetically modifying crops</em>: plant species’ genes are changed
when a gene, sometimes from a non-plant species, is inserted
to create a new species that has never before existed on Earth
and arrives almost overnight without evolving alongside its
environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is hard to control or predict the mixing of genes plants. Once
GMOs are involved, unintended consequences can result. The
<strong>impacts</strong> of GMO seed on traditional crops and ecosystems are
being actively studied by agricultural scientists. In the meantime,
the Hopi must protect their corn’s genes from mixing with
genetically modified genes. They must protect the purity of the corn
varieties that are at the center of their culture.</li>

<h4>Handout: Traditional Hopi planting techniques</h4>
<p><strong>Traditional Hopi planting techniques for Dryland Farming of Corn</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Spacing is an important consideration for plant health, root development and good pollination. Unlike the conventional practice of planting seeds in a row and measuring the space between seeds, the Hopi plant several seeds together in a clump and pace off, with measured steps, the space between clumps. Spacing in a Hopi garden is 2–3 adult paces/steps, or 4–6 feet, between clumps. Widely spaced plant clumps creates groups of reservoirs of moisture for each clump.</li>
<li>To plant, the ground is first scraped with the hands or the side of the foot to remove dust/loose top soil on the surface to the depth of hardpan or compacted soil. The soil that comes out of the hole must not be tossed far away from the opening. It must be pulled back only as far as necessary. This creates a 2x2 foot basin.</li>
<li>In the center of the basin, the digging stick, or <em>so’ya</em> is used to create a hole. The correct depth of the hole is reached when the soil’s moisture can be seen and felt. The hole should be the shape of a cone, no wider than 4 inches, and 6–10 inches deep.</li>
<li>About 12 seeds are planted into each hole. Later, when the plants are approximately 1 foot tall, the clump is thinned to about 6 plants.</li>
<li>The soil must be placed back in the hole in same order that it was removed: the moist soil that was the last to be removed is the first to be returned.</li>
<li>To finish, some of the loose topsoil from the edge of the basin is brushed and scattered over the filled-in hole. This creates a “dust mulch” that seals in moisture.</li>
<li>Two to three adult paces/steps are taken to the next planting clump location.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Traditional Hopi planting techniques for Dryland Farming of Bean, Squash and Melon</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Repeat step #2 from Corn Planting Techniques, with the exception that the basin created is only 1x1 foot.</li>
<li>These varieties are planted deep enough that each seed is surrounded by moist soil, approximately 5–7 inches deep.</li>
<li>Four to five seeds are planted in each hole. Later, when the plants are approximately 6 inches tall, the clump is thinned to 2 plants.</li>
<li>To finish, some of the loose topsoil from the edge of the basin is used as a dust mulch to cover the hole.</li>
<li>One adult pace/step is taken to the next planting location.</li>
<li>Traditionally these varieties are planted in separate areas but could be interplanted between corn clumps.</li>
