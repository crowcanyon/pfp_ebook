The PFP would not have been possible without the support of the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center’s Native American Advisory Group, which was under the direction of Margie Connolly when the project began. Paul Ermigiotti and Grant Coffey tended to the gardens and recorded the data presented here, and they have been assisted by staff members at Crow Canyon, researchers at the University of North Texas, and devoted volunteers. In particular, Read Brugger participated in monitoring the gardens and took most of the beautiful photos presented in this book. The Pueblo Farming Project began when the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office requested Crow Canyon conduct research into Pueblo agriculture. An initial planning meeting was conducted in 2006 and the gardens were first planted and harvested in 2008; this work was partially funded by two grants from The Christensen Fund. Subsequent funding was provided by National Geographic Society’s Genographic Legacy Fund (2009) and by National Science Foundation grants DGE-1347973 and DEB-0816400 that supported the Village Ecodynamics Project. Recently, the PFP received funding from the History Colorado State Historical Fund (grant 2015-02-025). "],
["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction Farming is a fundamental part of Pueblo identity. It is is integrated into every aspect of traditional Pueblo culture. Pueblo leaders are concerned with preserving knowledge about farming and ensuring that this knowledge is transmitted to younger generations. Crow Canyon researchers and educators are interested in learning about traditional agriculture in order to better understand ancient farming practices—and to gain a deeper appreciation for the role of corn in Pueblo society, past and present. The Pueblo Farming Project is a collaborative effort that addresses the interests of both groups. Since 2006, the Crow Canyon staff has worked with traditional Pueblo farmers from Hopi, Arizona, to document their farming practices and the cultural context in which they take place. Every year, Hopi farmers have visited Crow Canyon in the spring and fall to teach the Center’s researchers and educators about Pueblo Indian farming, food storage, and food preparation. Together, farmers and staff have planted and harvested several experimental gardens on Crow Canyon’s campus, testing farming techniques and varieties of seeds used by the Pueblo farmers in their own fields. Documentation for the project includes still photography, video and audio recordings of planting and harvesting, and a variety of written records, including detailed measurements of plants at different stages of growth, daily temperature and precipitation values, crop yields, and preliminary results of corn DNA analysis. Data generated as part of the Pueblo Farming Project have already proven useful in broader research. For example, Village Ecodynamics Project scientists have compared the results of their computer simulations with corn harvest yields from the Pueblo Farming Project to better understand ancient environmental conditions and agricultural productivity—and the effects of both on human settlement patterns.

["what-was-the-pfp.html", "1.1 What was the PFP?", " 1.1 What was the PFP? History of the Pueblo Farming Project: 2004–2017 The Beginning The beginning of the Pueblo Farming Project (PFP) can be traced to a September 2004 Native American Graves and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) consultation for Crow Canyon’s Goodman Point Archaeological Project. National Park Service staff and Crow Canyon archaeologists met with Hopi Cultural Preservation Office staff at their office in Kykotsmovi, Arizona to discuss the research design for this project. When we concluded our discussion we asked the Hopi if there were research topics that interested them that were not covered in the research design, and they quickly responded that they wanted to know more about ancestral Pueblo farming and how it compared to the agricultural practices of Hopi and other Pueblo people today. From these beginnings, the PFP has been developed through a partnership between Crow Canyon and Pueblo farmers, especially the farmers from Hopi whose participation in the project has been coordinated through the Hopi Cultural Preservation Office. Designing the Project The participants in the May 2006 Puablo farming planning meeting. To follow through on this request, Crow Canyon developed the first of a series of grants to support a collaborative project on Pueblo farming (see section below on Who Funded the PFP). The initial grant funded a planning meeting in May 2006 where we discussed the various types of research that could investigate ancestral Pueblo farming practices and link them to techniques used by modern Pueblo farmers. Participants at the meeting included traditional Pueblo farmers from Hopi, Jemez, Ohkay Owingeh, and Tesuque; Crow Canyon staff; and other anthropologists who specialize in the study of ancestral and modern Pueblo agriculture. After two days of discussion, this group decided to implement an experimental gardening project that focused on rain-fed farming because this was the main type of farming practiced by the ancestral Pueblo in the Mesa Verde region. We use “rain-fed farming” to represent agricultural practices that use little to no large-scale landscape modification, but that readily take advantage of local landform and soil characteristics to enhance soil moisture (such as areas of higher runoff or greater snow accumulation) and often include small-scale anthropogenic modifications such as check dams. The group agreed that Hopi should take the lead as the traditional farming experts, since they still practice rain-fed farming whereas most other contemporary Pueblo tribes use more intensive flood-plain and canal irrigation techniques. Crow Canyon agreed to seek grant funding for the project that became known as the PFP. Selecting Garden Locations Locating fields during the 2007 PFP meetings. The next step occurred in 2007 when Hopi farmers met to select locations for the gardens. We originally hoped to place these gardens at the Goodman Point Unit of Hovenweep National Monument to complement our ongoing research there, but we did not get permission for this and decided instead to locate the gardens on Crow Canyon’s campus to integrate the PFP into the Center’s education programs. Pueblo farmers used traditional ecological knowledge to select the garden locations, focusing on the native plants that indicate good areas for farming. Rabbitbrush and snakeweed are two plants they see as indicating prime areas, but dense stands of those plants were not present on Crow Canyon’s campus. In the absence of such indicator species, they selected two areas in small washes on the east side of Crow Canyon that are dominated by sagebrush today. The farmers assessed soils for their texture and moisture-holding capacity and examined the details of specific settings including slope, aspect, and other factors. Although the Hopi farmers did not consider these two locations as ideal, they thought they would be adequate. One location had sage that was unusually tall; this area was located near the mouth of a small wash coming from the east slope of the Crow Canyon drainage. When this area was cleared, an ancient check dam was found and subsequently recorded (5MT19690). This was named the Check Dam Garden (CDG). The other plot was located higher up in a small drainage to the north in an area where there was a thick patch of verdant grass. The Hopi farmers thought there might be a spring in this area but subsequent work showed this was not the case. We call this plot the Pueblo Learning Center (PLC) garden because it is on the way to one of Crow Canyon’s outdoor classrooms. In addition to these new plots, the Hopi farmers suggested we continue planting a garden that Paul Ermigiotti had earlier developed for Crow Canyon’s educational programs. We call this Paul’s Old Garden (POG), and it is located on the valley floor in the bottom of Crow Canyon. In 2009, we added two additional garden areas. The first, the Pithouse garden (PHG), was placed on the west slope of Crow Canyon and adjacent to Crow Canyon’s Pithouse Learning Center to incorporate the garden into the lessons that occur there. The PHG garden had anomalously low yields for several years and soil profiles showed that the area had been disturbed when the adjacent replica pithouse was constructed (the garden soils contained construction materials), so we abandoned this garden after the 2014 growing season. The second garden added in 2009 was Karen’s Upper Garden (KUG), which was a plot farmed by Karen Adams in the 1990s and located on the mesa just west of Crow Canyon. Karen farmed this garden as part of Crow Canyon public education program and to quantify yields. The KUG garden has produced relatively low yields, which surprised us because evidence suggests that the mesa tops covered in Mesa Verde loess-derived soils were the area most intensively farmed by ancestral Pueblo people. This evidence includes the fact that most ancestral Pueblo habitation sites are near these loess soils on the mesa tops, and the fact that these loess-derived, mesa-top soils are the focus of contemporary dryland farming. To better evaluate the variation in these mesa-top settings, we added an additional garden in 2015 at Mike Coffey’s farm near Dove Creek, Colorado (the Mike Coffey garden or MCG). The PFP garden locations allow us to measure the effect of a variety of microenvironmental factors on agricultural potential. For example, the Crow Canyon gardens allow us to evaluate the effect of cold air that flows in drainages. The length of the frost-free period varies considerably despite relatively small differences in elevation and in the distance between the plots. The gardens are also located on soils with different characteristics and the effects of soil variability are the primary focus of this study. Planting and Harvesting: 2008–2017 The participants in the initial planting of the PFP gardens in 2008. We planted and harvested gardens for the first time in 2008, with the work focused on the CDG, PLC, and POG gardens. From 2009–2014 we planted five gardens: the CDG, PLC, POG, PHG, and KUG gardens. From 2015–2017 we planted the CDG, PLC, POG, KUG, and MCG gardens. During this time, Pueblo farmers served as the expert consultants for planting and harvesting. Most of the farmers are from Hopi, but farmers from other Pueblos have also participated. Crow Canyon staff members learn from the Pueblo farmers and assist in the planting and harvesting. Pueblo Farming Project Goals From the beginning, the PFP has pursued educational and research goals that were developed by Hopi and Crow Canyon working together. Since 2008, Hopi farmers have traveled to Crow Canyon twice a year: once in the spring for a planting meeting and again in the fall for a harvest meeting. Each meeting includes discussions to review goals, evaluate the project’s progress, and develop a plan for how to proceed with current and future initiatives. Of course, each meeting also includes work in the agricultural plots. All PFP activities have been recorded using numerous techniques: written notes from each meeting, audio and video recording, still photography, and written documentation that include detailed metrics on the plants and their growing environments. This has produced a rich dataset from which we produced several research and educational products. One of the PFP research goals was to evaluate how agricultural yields were affected by annual variation in temperature and precipitation. These data were integrated into another research project known as the Village Ecodynamics Project or VEP. The VEP was funded by two National Science Foundation grants awarded to Washington State University; Crow Canyon was a subcontractor on the project. A multidisciplinary collaboration, the VEP included archaeologists, geologists, hydrologists, geographers, computer scientists, and economists from institutions across the U.S. and Canada. VEP researchers studied the interaction between Pueblo Indian people and their environment over more than a thousand years, beginning in A.D. 600. One aspect of the VEP was to use computer modeling to estimate ancestral Pueblo agricultural yields and how they varied through time and across the project study areas. Actual PFP yields were compared to the VEP estimates to evaluate the accuracy of the computer model. Detailed information about the VEP can be found at this website: http://www.veparchaeology.org/. Hopi goals for the project were tied to the central role of corn and corn farming in Hopi culture. Fundamentally, they were interested in whether their seed and their traditional farming techniques would result in successful harvests in the Mesa Verde region, a place they consider as part of their ancestral homeland. For Hopi, the PFP provided a substantive link between their past and the present. For Hopi, the PFP helped demonstrate their cultural affiliation to the Mesa Verde region, and beyond planting and harvesting gardens they pursued this goal through another PFP research initiative: the DNA analysis of modern Hopi corn. Education Products From the beginning, the PFP was integrated into Crow Canyon’s education programs. School groups who are at Canyon when planting and harvesting occurs observe and at times participate in these activities. Pueblo farmers speak to the students about the project and the role of farming in Pueblo culture, creating a unique and memorable learning experience for these students. The Pueblo Farming Project gardens are also integrated into Crow Canyon education programs during the growing season, providing the students with a powerful visual as the Center’s educators teach about the importance of corn farming in ancestral and modern Pueblo communities. We also developed series of educational initiatives to reach a larger audience with what we have learned through the PFP. We highlight three of these initiatives here. The first educational product we highlight is a documentary film, More than Planting a Seed: A second educational product is an exhibit on display at the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center. This exhibit describes the project, presents our results, and tells the story of corn. Finally, we created and piloted five standards-aligned lessons for the classroom. Those lessons plans are included in this e-book. Public education initiatives also include lectures for the public and presentations at professional meetings. Information about the PFP was also disseminated through Crow Canyon’s electronic and print newsletters and on Crow Canyon’s website. The PFP was also featured on local radio shows, including an interview with Leigh Kuwanwisiwma on KSJD’s Big Fat Farm Show. "],

["the-story-of-maize.html", "Chapter 2 The Story of Maize", " Chapter 2 The Story of Maize The relationship between humans and corn (or maize, Zea mays ssp. mays) is a long and interesting story. The path to domestication began about 9,000 years ago in southwestern Mexico. The domestication process led to a unique codependency: as it exists today, corn is not able to reproduce without human intervention. But humans have also become dependent upon this plant. Today, corn is the most widely produced grain crop in the United States, though only a tiny fraction of the corn grown directly feeds people. Most of what we consume is in the form of high-fructose corn sweeteners. Most corn production goes toward animal feed, ethanol and exports. Corn has become less of an important food resource and more of a refined industrial product. In contrast, corn holds an important place in the origin myths and lifeways of many native cultures. In Pueblo cultures, maize plays a vital position physically, spiritually, and symbolically. Corn as directional symbols: white—northeast, yellow—northwest, red—southeast, blue—southwest. "],
["origins.html", "2.1 Origins", " 2.1 Origins The domestication of maize was unique. Typically, domesticated plants look similar to their wild ancestors; However, an ear of corn’s closest wild relative, teosinte, is noticeably different from an ear of modern corn. An ear of maize is wrapped in a husk, the kernels are held tightly and not able to scatter or free themselves from the cob, so they would compete with each other for nutrients and water. Corn is as dependent on humans as humans are dependent on corn. Maize differs from its closest wild relativve, teosinte. Copyright Oxford University Press, all rights reserved. Teosinte, a wild grass native to Mexico and Central America, is so closely related to maize that it belongs to the same species— Zea mays ssp. parviglumis. Despite their shared ancestry, the plants differ in significant ways: Maize grows as a single stalk with a few large ears. Teosinte is branched with many small ears. Maize ears are encased in a husk with hundreds of kernels on the cob. Teosinte ears have eight to 12 kernels, each surrounded by a hard fruit-case. Maize ears typically have 8 to 16 rows of kernels. Teosinte ears have two rows of kernels. Maize kernels must be separated from the ear and planted by humans. Teosinte ears shatter when dry and the seeds scatter, distributed by gravity, birds and other animals "],
["the-people-of-corn.html", "2.2 The people of corn", " 2.2 The people of corn Maize entered the southwestern United States about 4000 years ago. On its long journey from Mexico, maize has adapted from its tropical environment, with 12 hours of daylight to the semi-arid, long summer days and cool-night conditions of the Colorado Plateau. Farming techniques also had to adapt. Dryland or direct-precipitation agriculture is dependent on moisture stored in the soil from precipitation and runoff water. Pueblo people have dryland farmed the arid southwest for millennia. They have accumulated detailed knowledge of their environment and have adopted specialized planting techniques. Dryland farming is an act of faith that binds the people to their land and their beliefs, requiring hard work, song and prayer. Traditional dryland farming techniques include: knowing plants that indicate adequate soil moisture. Several plant species are regarded as key indicators when it comes to agricultural field selection. Rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus), snakeweed (Gutierrezia), grease wood (Sarcobatus), fourwing saltbush (Atriplex), and ricegrass (Oryzopsis) typically indicate good soil moisture. Corn is likely to do well where these indicator species grow vigorously. planting seeds deeply Seeds are planted deep, about eight to 12 inches, so they will come in contact with moist soil. This ensures the seeds receive all the benefits of winter moisture and a deep root system. planting seeds in clumps By planting 10 to 15 seeds together, the young plants protect each other from the harsh sun and winds. Also, by planting many seeds together, the chance of total loss from insects, birds or rodents is reduced. planting with wide spacing between clumps Clumps are spaced about 1.5 to 2 meters apart to ensure adequate surface area to absorb precipitation and reduces competition from other plants for moisture stored in the soil. planting on north-facing slopes planting in alluvial floodplains. Less exposure to direct sun light reduces evaporation and conserves soil moisture. Alluvial floodplains provide deep sediment deposits that have increased moisture storage abilities. A bag of seed, a digging stick and a gourd of water; the gifts of life. When the people emerged into this world Masau’u provided the people with three gifts; a planting stick (so’ya) a bag of seeds and a gourd of water. He handed them a small ear of blue corn and told the people: “Here is my life and my spirit. This is what I have to give you.” — A portion of a Hopi origin story To contemporary Pueblo people, corn is considered a mother, because sustains the people both physically and spiritually. Corn is also a child, and needs constant protection and encouragement to grow to maturity. After harvest, the plants die and are laid to rest just as people are. Nourishment provided by corn in turn allows the people to care for the growing plants. The symbolic cycle of corn and people repeats over and over. "],
["a-world-of-corn.html", "2.3 A world of corn", " 2.3 A world of corn Maize was unknown outside the New World before the sixteenth-century. Because of its ability to grow in diverse climates, it spread rapidly to the rest of the world and became the staple it is today. Corn is used in thousands of every day products from cosmetics and crayons to ethanol fuel. The success of maize worldwide can be attributed to the following: Adaptation — Adaptive ability to grow in a wide variety of environmental conditions from sea level to 1100 feet from 5 to 170 inches precipitation annually Variability in appearance — Ears and kernels display a diverse range in sizes, colors and endosperm textures. There are thousands of varieties of corn to choose from in seed catalogs: open-pollenated, heirloom, hybrid, and even genetically modified. Variability in kernel shape, size and color as well as differences in ear size demonstrates the incredible diversity in maize. Most corn varieties can be divided into five types based on endosperm texture, or the amount of hard versus soft starch in the kernel. Kernels showing endosperm type: pop, flint, flour, dent and sweet corn (left to right). Each type varies in ratios of hard (dark) to soft (white) starch and sugar. The seed embryo is located at the bottom of the kernel. Versatility — Products range from cereal and sweeteners to fuel, stored as dried grain, liquid sweeteners or alcohol can be eaten boiled, roasted, popped or ground. Productivity resulting in high yields a single corn kernel can produce from 500–800 kernels per ear, usually two ears per plant. Genetic diversity is important in adapting to a wide variety of environments and conditions. Hopi farmers have at least 17 locally adapted varieties of corn. This diversity allows plants to adjust to the harsh environment of the region and reduce the risk of crop failure. "],

["soil.html", "4.1 Soil", " 4.1 Soil What are soils? Soil is made of a combination of minerals, organic matter, and sand. These three ingredients are combined in different amounts and travel long distances around the globe through the movements of glaciers, water, and wind. Soils store water and nutrients that plants use to flourish. How does soil gain water? Water is delivered to the soil in two ways: The Earth’s Water Cycle: precipitation in the form of rain, snow and ice. In the Southwest, the most important weather events that deliver water to the soil are winter snowstorms and summer monsoon rains. Water Management: Humans capture and store water from the water cycle and spread it on the soil using irrigation systems. This video from The Monsoon Project describes the importance of the North American Monsoon to the Southwest. How does soil lose water? Soils lose water through a process called evapotranspiration. This means the soil loses moisture through direct evaporation and through plant tissues, due to the wind and the sun. Breaking this term into two parts helps reveal this definition: Transpiration — plants sweat out and lose water they have received from the soil Evaporation — the soil loses water due to the wind and the sun To slow this process down, farmers often use a technique called mulching. Mulch is: A material that is spread over a planting area, protecting the soil from the effects of the wind and the sun. A layer of insulation that traps moisture and shades the soil, preventing the water in the soil from evaporating. Carbon-based materials such as straw or dry grass clippings. Pueblo farmers, such as the Hopi, use dust and sand as a mulch; they covered the moist soil that held their seeds with a thick layer of sand and dust. Why do some farmers apply irrigation water to their soil? Some farmers irrigate because: They are replacing the water that their plants and soils have lost due to evapotranspiration. Some plants require more water than the environment has to offer; the farmers apply irrigation water to make up for water that does not arrive in the form of rain and snow. Some modern farmers do not apply irrigation water to their soil: Hopi farmers who have vast dryland corn fields. Farmers from the western states who have large dryland crop farms. Many Hopi farmers and other farmers in the Southwestern US do not use irrigation systems; the keys to their success is understanding weather patterns, caring for their soil, planting drought-resilient seeds and having faith in natural cycles. “Dry-farming in the high desert….relying only on precipitation and runoff water, requires an almost miraculous level of faith and is sustained by hard work, prayer, and an attitude of deep humility.” — Wall and Masayesva 2004:436 How do dryland farmers decide where to place their gardens and fields? Why is this decision so important? Choosing the location of a garden is called “site selection”. It is important to dryland farming because the chosen site must be able to capture and hold water delivered by the Water Cycle, making it “drought-resilient”. These are the features that the ancestral Pueblo farmers of the past and the Hopi dryland farmers of today look for in a site that will be drought-resilient: Geography: Water that drains off of a mesa or cliff will collect and flood down into drainages, washes, arroyos or canyons. Where these features become less narrow and open up into sandy slopes, Pueblo farmers expect water and good soil to collect because it is washed down with the floodwaters. This mouth or opening is also a place where they traditionally built check dams: rows of low rock walls to slow down the movement of runoff water. Garden slope: North-facing slopes have more shade, therefore less water is lost to evaporation. Indicator plants: The appearance of certain plants in early spring give information, or indicate, to Hopi and other Dryland farmers about where the best places are for a garden/field, how deep to plant and how much space to leave between plants. Farmers combine these indications with practice, experience and knowledge of the land. Some examples of plants that indicate these conditions are: CONDITION INDICATOR PLANT Good soil moisture Rabbitbrush Four-wing saltbrush Mormon tea Rice grass Snakeweed Deep, well drained soil Rabbitbrush Oak trees Soil moisture depth: deep, soft soils that allows natural reservoirs of water to collect in and be held deep in the soil. Soil color: darker colors often mean higher amounts of decomposed organic matter and nutrients in the soil. In the Southwest, this means dark red-brown. Large, open planting area: the area must be large enough that clumps of seeds can be planted with wide spaces between them (2-3 adult paces/steps or 4 - 6 feet, between clumps.) This spacing allows little soil-moisture reservoirs to be created between clumps, providing long-term moisture. Drought When a normal amount of snow and rain does not arrive year after year, this is called a “drought”. How do Puebloan farmers respond to drought? The Hopi people use the agricultural knowledge gained through their ancestral dryland farming practices. They want to ensure their crops will continue to be drought-resilient into the future. To survive drought, a dryland farmer must know a lot about their soil and their seeds. Ancestral Pueblo farmers responded to drought by: anticipating the possibility that it could arrive any year, and preparing for it by saving seeds from plants that can survive drought. using the site selection factors listed above as test questions to decide whether or not a site will be drought-resilient. meeting these site requirements by planting in multiple locations. using clumps of plants at the edge of the planting area, or tin cans placed around seedlings, as a windbreak to decrease evapotranspiration. Covering holes that contain seeds with loose topsoil to act as a “dust mulch”. Do other dryland farmers use any of these same practices? Yes, though some farmers emphasize knowing the soil through soil testing: First, farmers learn what is in their soil to determine what kind of soil they have. Second, farmers find out how much water their soil can hold. If the soil receives more water than it can hold, much of the extra water will drain away. Water that is wasted in this way is called runoff; it leads to erosion, when soil is carried away by the runoff.

["procedure.html", "5.1 Procedure", " 5.1 Procedure Planting The primary tool for planting is a planting stick or, in the Hopi language, a soya. Traditionally a soya is made from of greasewood (Sarcobatus vermicalatus), but some planting sticks today are made from a length of metal pipe with a narrow blade welded to one end. Planting begins by using your foot to scrape away the upper layer of loose, dry dirt. This exposes the top of the underlying hard-packed soil. About a square foot area is cleared. The planter gets down on one knee and grabs the soya with one hand low and one hand higher up on the tool. A narrow hole is dug using a pulling motion toward the planter. Typically, the hole is dug to a depth of about 8 to 10 inches or to the point where good soil moisture is encountered. The hole is dug deeper if the soil is drier and shallower if the soil is moist. This soil moisture is critical for plant germination and for the plant to be able to grow until there is more precipitation, something that might not occur until many weeks after planting. Hopi farmers plant corn in clumps. About 10-20 seeds are deposited into the hole. The excavated earth is put back gently into the hole in the order it was removed, the moist soil covering the seeds on the bottom and the drier soil on top. The loose dry dirt is on the top, but a small basin is created on the surface to collect any precipitation that falls and to create a dust mulch that reduces evaporation. The farmer stands and takes two or three steps to measure where the next clump of corn will be planted. Because the soils in the PFP gardens hold a bit more moisture than those soils near the Hopi mesas, the PFP clumps are typically spaced about 1.5- 1.75 meters apart rather than the three-meter spacing typically used at Hopi. The wide spacing of the planted clumps reduces competition for valuable sub-surface moisture. When the garden planting has been completed the farmers call out “kwakwhay”, thank you! Flick through these slides to see how planting is done the Hopi way! The descriptions are based on Notes On Hopi Economic Life by Earnest Beaglehole, 1937. Monitoring The procedures for monitoring the gardens were based on those developed by Benjamin Bellorado in an experimental gardening study that he developed for the Animas-LaPlata archaeological project and for his MA thesis at Northern Arizona University. For the majority of the PFP these procedures were implemented by Paul Ermigiotti and staff and volunteers who assisted him. Monitoring was conducted each week. The primary objective was to record growth stages, to document damage by pests, and to make other observations about the condition of the gardens. The data were recorded on paper forms in the field and input into a database at a later time. The data collected each week on growth stages includes the following: Height — The height of the tallest plant in each clump was recorded to the nearest 5 cm. Early Tassel Development — Early tassel development was recorded when it occurred on any plant in a clump. Early tassel development is defined as the time when the tassel bud starts to emerge from the central enclosing leaves at the top of the stalk to the time the tassel spike begins to branch. Tassel Development — Tassel development was recorded each week when it occurred on any plant in a clump. Tassel development is defined from time when the tassel emerges from the central cluster of leaves and begins to branch. This stage ends when the anthers (male flowers) emerge from the glumes of the tassel and the pollen begins to shed. Tasseling — The period of tasseling was recorded for when it occurred on any plant in a clump. The tasseling period is defined when the apex inflorescences (a group of flowers) begins to open. The anthers (male flowers) emerge and begin to shed pollen. At this stage the stalk has produced all its leaves and the plant has reached full height. Silk Development — Silk development was recorded when it occurred on any plant in a clump. Silk development is defined when ear shoots become visible in the nodes (between the leaf and stalk) until the silks have fully emerged and are ready to receive pollen. Silking — Silk development was recorded when it occurred on any plant in a clump. Silking is defined when the silk has emerged from the husk surrounding the developing cob and is capable of receiving pollen. A single silk will deliver pollen and develop into individual kernel. Once the silks have begun to dry and shrivel, this growth stage has ended. Ear Development — Ear development was recorded when it occurred on any plant in a clump. Ear development is defined as once the silks have dried out, shriveled, and are no longer accepting pollen, and continues until the kernels mature and the ear is ready to harvest. A hard frost (below 28 ° F.) will prematurely end ear development. Harvesting The harvest and yield data entry for the Pueblo Farming Project is a three step process that includes collecting the corn from the field, weighing the ears just after harvest, then, when the ears have completely dried, they are weighed again to enter the dry kernel weight for each ear. On harvest day, typically in mid-October, after the ears have sufficiently ripened on the stalk, the farmers approach the garden with anticipation. All of the ears from each stalk in a clump are shucked, the silk removed and the ears are recorded and tagged according to the clump, stalk and ear. After the ears are collected from a clump the stalks are bent over at the base and laid to rest on the ground. This laying to rest of the stalks is part of the life process that cycle through birth, maturation and death. The stalks left in the garden also help with the spacing in the next year’s planting. Planting in between the stalks ensure that seeds are not planted in the same place two years in a row. After harvest the ears are weighed to obtain a “wet weight” as there is still considerable moisture remaining in the ears. The ears are the placed on trays and allowed to dry for two months. When the ears have thoroughly dried, each ear is weighed whole, and then with the kernels removed. Ear, cob and kernel weights are entered into the data base. Additional information on the ear is also recorded such as the number of rows of kernels, kernel color, and the completeness of kernel filling on the ear. The categories, or condition of the ear are: Full — more than two-thirds of the kernels present Partial — one-third to two-thirds of the kernels are present Sparse — up to one-third of the kernels are present, and Immature — there are no kernels present on the cob.

["what-we-learned.html", "Chapter 6 What we learned", " Chapter 6 What we learned Through the Pueblo Farming Project (PFP), researchers, educators and volunteers have gained a deeper appreciation of traditional Pueblo Indian agricultural practices and the role of corn, or maize, in Pueblo society, both past and present. The Pueblo farmers, especially our Hopi colleagues, shared their knowledge of corn farming with us, and they taught us how this plant-and the preservation their agricultural practices-are essential to their cultural continuity. The PFP the Pueblo consultants agreed that the Hopi farmers should take the lead in the project, as they still practice direct-precipitation farming in their homeland. This type of farming relies strictly on direct precipitation and rainfall runoff. The length of the growing season is longer in the Hopi region, the soil makeup is different, and annual precipitation is less compared to the Mesa Verde region. Despite these differences, the Hopi consider the Mesa Verde region part of their ancestral homeland, and they wanted to know if their farming techniques would work in this area that was almost 200 miles distant. Archaeological remains show that maize spread into the greater American southwest about 4,000 years ago. For archaeologists, the appearance of corn farming signals the beginning of Pueblo Indian culture. The Hopi also see their origins as tied to the appearance of maize. The Hopi oral history tells how Masau’u, ancient caretaker of the earth, presented them with the gift of corn (qa’ö) upon their emergence from the underworld. The gift included a bag of seed, a planting stick, and a gourd filled with water. Farming corn became their identity, and this lifeway based on humility and perseverance in a harsh landscape, offered them a long and spiritually rich life. Scientific studies have determined that by 2,400 years ago the earliest farmers in the Four Corners region had a diet that was heavily dependent on maize. It appears that by that time, maize made up about 70% of Pueblo people’s caloric intake. DNA testing of 12 named Hopi maize varieties, undertaken by the PFP, show that Hopi maize is genetically distinct, although it is closely related to other temperate maize from the US southwest. The Hopi samples are closely associated with ancient corn samples that were tested in separate studies. The studies also show the Hopi varieties have also undergone continued selection over the past 2,000 years. Archaeological evidence of farming in the region include items such as planting sticks, manos, metates, check-dams, storage facilities and abundant corn remains. These artifacts attest to the persistence of agricultural practices in the Southwest since maize was first introduced, and reinforce the continuity of these traditional practices at Hopi. In summarizing what we have learned about Pueblo farming in the Mesa Verde region, a good place to begin is with a discussion of how and why “Pueblo farming” is different from conventional “modern farming” practices?&quot; The Colorado Plateau poses many challenges to farming not present elsewhere. The elevation ranges from 4,500 to 13,000 feet above sea level, with the dry-land farming belt running from about 5,500 to 7,500 feet. Daily temperatures fluctuate widely here during the growing season with hot days and cool nights. Cold air drains and settles into lower elevations on the landscape, and PFP temperature monitors have shown that in some locations the length of the frost-free growing season can often be well below the 120 day span typically thought necessary for corn production. For one of the PFP gardens, POG, the frost-free growing season had been just over 100 days on several occasions. Two gardens, POG and MCG, illustrate the differences in cold air drainage. The MCG, is located at a much higher elevation (800 ft. higher), but nearby canyons drain cold air away from the plot. This field had a longer frost-free season. In contrast, the POG, is located at a lower elevation, and should be warmer but it is situated at the bottom of a canyon that collects cold air from the adjacent higher ground, resulting in a shorter growing season. Precipitation can vary greatly across the Southwest. This variation can be affected by elevation as well as annual jetstream patterns. Extended droughts are not uncommon. Annual precipitation ranges from 5 inches to 19.5 inches across of the Four Corners region. The annual precipitation for the PFP study area averaged 11.9 inches during the 10 years between 2008 and 2017, which is close to the long-term average for nearby Cortez, Colorado. The Mesa Verde region experiences a bimodal weather pattern that delivers the majority of its precipitation in the winter months of November through March, and during the summer monsoons which typically occurs from July to September. Some of the hottest and driest weather occurs in the months of May, June and early July. The most favored agricultural locations are often on the deep eolian or wind-blown soils, which are reddish in color. These soils, and good winter precipitation, are the key to successful farming without irrigation in the Mesa Verde region. These soils retain valuable subsurface moisture that carries seedlings and young plants through the driest part of the year without supplemental water. Caliche and mineral salts can build up in some soils. This build up can restrict root growth and affect plant development. The KUG experimental garden was placed in a mesa top location not far from ancestral Pueblo archaeological sites. This seemed like an ideal location with deep soil and a long frost-free growing season. Relatively poor yields from this garden, however, indicate a deficiency in some unseen factor that affects yields. With such variability in precipitation, soil, temperature and cold air drainage, the nature of direct-precipitation farming in the Mesa Verde region could be considered a “roll of the dice” in any given year. Pueblo subsistence farmers would have to have had a very specific understanding of the landscape and the conditions that can result in crop success or failure. The first step in the process was selecting the garden locations. Prime locations for gardening on Crow Canyon’s campus were somewhat limited due to preexisting infrastructure, so the placement of our gardens was not ideal. In the areas available, the Pueblo farmers used the growth of certain native plants to guide their selection of appropriate field locations. Rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), snakeweed (Guitierrezia sarothrae) and dense stands of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) grow in soils thought to be indicative of good areas for raising corn. Five gardens on the Crow Canyon campus and one garden-located almost 40 miles northwest of campus-in a prime dry-land bean farming area presented a variety of conditions that allowed us to measure and compare different settings in terms of their agricultural potential. Initially, several different varieties of Hopi maize were planted in the PFP gardens. Over the years the selection was reduced to two: white flour corn (qotsaqa’ö) and blue flour corn (sakwapqa“ö). &lt;img src=“./images/chapter_6_soya.jpg” alt=“Traditional Hopi maize planting uses a digging stick, or”so’ya“/&gt; Most Americans would be familiar with the modern practice of planting corn closely spaced in long rows. Many have heard the story of how American Indians taught the pilgrims to plant corn in hills with fish a fertilizer. Traditional Hopi farming is quite distinct from these farming techniques. Planting technology is limited to a single tool: the planting stick or soya. Traditionally made from of greasewood (Sarcobatus vermicalatus), planting sticks today are often made from a length of metal pipe with a narrow blade welded to one end. Planting begins by scraping the area with sideways motion of the foot to push aside the loose and dry upper dust layer. This exposes the top of the underlying hard-packed soil. About a square foot, or slightly larger area, is cleared. The planter gets down on one knee and grabs the planting stick with one hand low and the other hand higher up on the tool. Then a narrow hole is dug in a pulling motion toward the planter to the desired depth. The hole is dug about 8 to 10 inches deep, or to the point where good soil moisture is encountered. It is important that there is sufficient soil where the seeds are deposited to ensure germination. The hole is dug deeper if the soil is drier and shallower if the soil is moist. The base of the hole is enlarged and about 10-20 seeds are deposited into the hole. The excavated earth is put back gently into the hole in the order it was removed, the moist soil covering the seeds on the bottom and the drier soil on top. A small well or basin is created around the planting with some of the loose top soil. This collects any precipitation that may fall and creates a mulch of dust that reduces evaporation. The farmer then stands and paces off two or three steps to where the next clump of corn will be planted. Because the soils in the PFP gardens hold a bit more moisture than those soils near the Hopi mesas, the clumps are typically spaced about 1.5- 1.75 meters apart rather than the three meter spacing typically used at Hopi. The wide spacing of the planted clumps reduces competition for valuable sub-surface moisture. When the garden planting has been completed the farmers call out “kwakwhay”, thank you! After germination, the seedlings emerge in about ten days. The closely grouped seedlings in each clump provide some mutual protection from the sun and wind. By early July, when the plants are about 18 inches tall, the leaves begin to bend over as if to touch the ground. At this time the number of young corn plants is reduced to about six in each clump. Weeding and monitoring for pests are ongoing tasks throughout the growing season. Newly emerged seedlings are vulnerable to cut worms that attack the stem just under the ground surface. Grasshoppers and ants can chew young plants to the ground. Rabbits destroyed whole gardens one dry summer. At Hopi today, and in our gardens, large cans with the tops removed are placed over the newly planted clumps to prevent cut worms, shade young plants, and protect them from spring winds. The Hopi deter rodents by soaking dog dung in a bucket, then spraying plants with the liquid by means of a rabbit brush switch. Crows, ravens and jays can pluck out young seedlings early in the season and, perhaps even more devastatingly, raid the garden at the end of a successful season. In unfenced fields such as those at Hopi, deer, elk and cattle are also known to destroy crops. Weeding to reduce any competition from other plants is especially important in dry-land farming. By far the most damaging invasive weed species in our gardens is field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensus). This rapidly spreading plant is native to Europe and was not a problem for ancestral Pueblo farmers and so far it doesn’t seem to be very common in the Hopi area. This plant is hard to eradicate and certainly is the biggest competitor for moisture and nutrients in our gardens. Some wild or semi cultivated plants are tolerated and allowed to remain in the garden. The young leaves of Rocky Mountain beeplant (Cleome serrulata), called “tuma” or wild spinach, are cooked and eaten. The leaves are also boiled down to make paint for pottery designs. Wild tobacco (Nicotonia attenuate) is widely used for ceremonial purposes. These plants and a small patch of wild potato (Solanum jamesii) have at times been allowed to grow in some of the PFP gardens. Hopi farmers have indicated the allowing tobacco to grow to close to the corn will impart a bad taste. The Hopi farmers have repeatedly stressed the importance of good thoughts and actions while tending to their fields. It is of utmost importance that the farmer’s heart be filled with good intention in the garden to ensure a bountiful harvest. When approaching a field, the farmer announces his return. Songs are composed and sung to the plants to provide encouragement for growth. Prayers for moisture are said while work in the field is carried out. The Hopi liken the development of their corn to the stages of a human life. The relationship of the farmer to the plant is analogous to that of a parent to a child. The corn goes through life much as a person does; as a child born, so too do the seedlings emerging from the earth. The plant sends out their first long leaves that bend over to touch the ground much as an infant learns to crawl. As a toddler they begin to stand upright and grow tall. The plants reach sexual maturity as they tassel and silk. Finally they produce offspring of their own as fully mature ears of corn. A perfect ear of white corn, full to the tip with kernels, is called a “mother ear” (tsotsmingwa). Such ears are presented to a child at birth and later used at important stages in an individual’s life. When the ears are harvested the plants are pushed over to the ground, so they can rest as they have completed their life. One of the research goals of the Pueblo Farming Project was to use the harvest yields from the gardens to evaluate the Village Ecodynamics Project (VEP) paleoproductivity model for ancestral Pueblo maize farming in the Mesa Verde region. The VEP modeled maize productivity estimates for all the soil types in the region, including estimates for the locations of the PFP gardens. The productivity estimates were created using soil type, a compilation of historical yields for those soils, reconstruction of annual precipitation based on tree rings, and calculation of the Palmer Drought Severity Index, which is a measure of stored soil moisture available for plant growth. Over the project’s history the harvest yields have varied greatly between gardens and even between clumps within the same garden, due in part to many of the factors stated previously. There is a high degree of correlation between yields from the gardens and the model estimates, but in some of the better years (greater precipitation) the PFP garden yields produced much more than the model estimated, and in bad years (less precipitation) the garden harvests were lower than the VEP estimates. As a result, there is far less variability in the VEP estimate yields compared to the PFP garden yields. The small size of our experimental gardens may have the effect of exaggerating some results. For example, there are years where our harvest yields for some gardens were near zero. It is possible that a larger plot would have produced better yields. The total precipitation and the timing of that precipitation seemed to be the greatest contributing factor in yields. Lower than average winter precipitation and a dry spring slows growth and causes plants to wilt early in the season. Heat stress during the reproductive stages brought on by delayed monsoon rains can also result in drastically lowered yields. In years when other vegetation suffered the effects of drought, gardens increasingly became the target of grasshoppers and rabbits. These nuanced occurrences might not be calculated into the modeling programs, but they would be noticed by the farmers. The annual PFP garden harvests were used to estimate maize yields as kilograms per hectare (2.47 acres). These estimates can be translated into the number of people the yields from a specific garden could have fed in a given year. An estimated average of 160 kilograms of corn per year per person has been assumed for a diet where about 70% of the calories come from corn. Our highest yields came from the CDG, in the year 2010. This garden produced an estimated 1372 kilograms per hectare, and would have fed eight people. The year 2015 produced the second highest yields in the POG, with an estimated 673 kg/ha and those yields potentially would feed four people. The average yields of all gardens over the years would feed one person per hectare. This means a family would need a vast amount of farmland, especially if a several year supply of food would be required in anticipation of a year of crop failure. The low average yields from the combined PFP gardens may be misleading. The gardens on the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center campus were not located in the prime agricultural lands available in the Mesa Verde region. Also, the amount of labor invested, such as that devoted to weeding and pest control, in the PFP gardens was likely minimal compared to the effort expended by a subsistence farmer. Again, the small size of the garden plots may have played a role in reduced yields. Increased vulnerability of crops to damage by pests, and edge effect (where the roots from vegetation surrounding the garden compete for valuable moisture) could impact yields when compared to those of a larger field. The time devoted to crops and the knowledge of the land gained from generations of farming is inestimable. The Hopi farmers have shown us that their seed and farming practices did produce yields in their ancestral homeland. The Village Ecodynamics Project paleoproductivity modeling has provided a means to assess agricultural productivity in the Mesa Verde region in the past and possibly the future. As we face the possibility of climate change and the challenge of feeding an ever increasing population, the lessons learned from the success and failures of the drought-prone farming in the American Southwest provide a unique opportunity to learn from and honor this traditional means of food production. As our Hopi teachers have taught us “keep a good heart, and pray for rain.” "],
["lesson-plans.html", "Chapter 7 Lesson plans", " Chapter 7 Lesson plans Ancestral Methods and Materials and Adaptations + Future Methods and Materials and Innovations = Self-Sufficiency &amp; Food Security These lessons were developed as a collaboration between the Montezuma School to Farm Project and the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center to reflect the educational sphere where archaeology, experiential education and agriculture intersect. The Montezuma School to Farm Project and Crow Canyon work with children and adults alike to bring the heritage of southwestern Colorado to life: providing hands-on experiences with the land and with the human legacy of farming in an arid and ancient landscape. The mission of the Montezuma School to Farm Project is to unite our local agricultural heritage with our growing future by engaging students at the crossroads of sustainable agriculture, resource conservation, health and economics through educational experiences in outdoor garden classes. The mission of Crow Canyon Archaeological Center is to empower present and future generations by making the human past accessible and relevant through archaeological research, experiential education, and American Indian knowledge. Together, we have created these lesson plans in order to link Crow Canyon’s Pueblo Farming Project research gardens to the academic lives of middle school students in the Four Corners region. Lesson Formats The lessons are presented in two formats to reflect the varying contexts in which the lessons may be used: long sessions of approximately 90 minutes, and short short sessions of approximately 45 minutes. The long sessions can be used during multi-day field trips students experience when they attend Crow Canyon’s school group archaeology programs. The short sessions can be used during the school day in a class that is held during a middle school science, social studies, or health class period. You will find both long and short sessions in the tabs at the top of the online version of each lesson. Both the long-form and short-form lessons are structured using three phases: Opening Circle, Working Groups or Procedure, and Closing Circle: Opening Circle When students arrive, they gather on outdoor classroom benches. We begin class with the opening circle and use this time to: Welcome and create a communicative atmosphere with students Introduce the activity or lesson, showing their connection to academic concepts in the Colorado Academic Standards Working Groups Students break into groups of approximately 6–8. During this time, we: Teach students to use real tools for authentic garden jobs, assisting if necessary Encourage decision making that utilizes the five senses Closing Circle Class concludes with the closing circle. Students reflect on their time in the garden with review of opening circle concepts or a brief activity. The e-book version of each lesson plan includes embedded videos and other interactive teaching materials. You may also download PDF versions of the lesson plans—links are at the top of each lesson. Unique Considerations: Living Props and Teaching to Climate Change Standards in Garden Lessons: How do these lesson plans integrate state educational standards? This manual aims to draw clear connections between food production (both ancestral and modern) and academic concepts central to middle school learning. Colorado’s science, comprehensive health, physical education, reading, social studies, and math standards met are listed at the conclusion of each lesson. For further information in regards to the Colorado Academic Standards: http://www2.cde.state.co.us/scripts/allstandards/COStandards.asp What are the benefits of using live teaching props? Some lessons require extra preparation, such as preparing soil or assembling materials, often multiple days in advance. In exchange for this preparation, educators gain a unique and high quality teaching prop. The use of living props ensures that the lesson will have a direct connection to the world outside of the classroom. They provide memorable examples and experiences that impact the senses, leading the concepts to be more thoroughly understood and strongly committed to memory. When we use living props, scientific concepts are brought to life. Why do we teach children about the Puebloan Farmers? Through learning the ancestral roots of our modern approaches to agriculture, children learn human history but also the history of the land they live on. This is a cornerstone of teaching student to be environmentally literate. It fosters an understanding of environmental issues by providing experiences that allow children to feel connected and related to all living creatures, helping them to fall in love with the world outside their back door. Beginning when they are very young, children easily and joyfully engage with the Earth’s cycles. Such experiences will lay a foundation of love and loyalty to their local ecosystems. On this foundation, the world’s most critical environmental challenges can be explored with optimism, challenging young minds to think deeply and critically about solutions. Confident of their place in the web of life, our younger generations can lead us back to the heartfelt awe nature so easily inspired during childhood. Optimal Garden Setup for Creating a Garden Classroom No two educational gardens are ever quite the same. Available space, materials, and resources influence a garden’s growth and allow it to become a living piece of the community. Sourcing talents and expertise locally adds further character to a garden and simultaneously builds relationships that sustain it. A garden’s educational opportunities are only amplified by its unique components. There are few constraints as far as what must exist in the space to maximize its educational potential. To complete the lessons in this manual, we suggest the following conditions: Bare Minimum Conditions Two 10’ x 4’ x 1’ raised beds or the equivalent in-ground row space. Access to a water spigot. A compost area or a space designated for a future compost site. The space should accommodate rotation through a three pile system: Active, building pile Aging pile Ready-for-use pile A large volume of dry, carbon-based materials to use as mulch and in the compost system. See below for advice on securing safe, herbicide-free sources. A source of nitrogen-based materials to use in the compost system. See page 7 for advice on securing safe, herbicide-free sources. Recommended Conditions Drip irrigation system with a timer - or plans for installation of a drip system Circle of benches and whiteboard to create an outdoor classroom space Tool shed Work table Securing Safe Sources:Carbon &amp; Nitrogen-Based Materials for Building Compost and Amending Soil Very often, carbon and nitrogen-based materials will have persistent herbicides in them (herbicides are substances that are toxic to plants and are used to destroy unwanted vegetation). Once sprayed, these chemicals will be absorbed by and persist in the plants’ bodies, even after they have passed through an animal’s digestive system; they will continue to persist in grass clippings or manure and end up in your compost pile. The resulting finished compost can deform or dramatically reduce yield, may kill your plants, and can contaminate your soil for years to come. When importing externally sourced materials, considering a donation, or purchasing of materials, it is very important to: Maintain the school garden use of herbicide-free methods. This includes interviewing the maintenance department staff about their methods of lawn and landscape care. This will help inform decisions about using grass clippings from the campus and can also lead to an agreement or understanding about herbicide use on the campus near the garden site. Carefully interview potential merchants or donors of any compost materials to attain the following information: Have herbicides of any kind been used on the straw, hay, grass clippings, weeds, leaf, or yard debris? Have the animals that produced the manure been fed hay, straw, other feed that was sprayed with herbicide? This can sometimes be an awkward conversation, as the person you are interviewing may become defensive. Many people are unaware of the term “persistent herbicides,” or lack a full understanding of how persistent herbicides affect vegetable production. Be prepared to be friendly but firm in your need to gather this information about your sources. These conversations can also be informative and eye-opening for all involved. Please use this link to the US Composting Council’s frequently asked questions about persistent herbicides: http://compostingcouncil.org/persistent-herbicide-faq/#3 Seed Donations Often, it is possible to attain seeds on a donation basis from individuals, families, or grocery/nursery/garden stores. It is important to assess the viability of these older seeds as some, but not all, will germinate beyond the “packed for/sell by” date listed on their packaging. It is deeply disappointing and disrupting when carefully planted and watered seeds do not germinate. The following are some examples of estimated time frames that seed varieties can be expected to last, past the “packed for/sell by” date. Please research the viability of additional seed varieties as needed. Up to 5 Years: annual flowers, collard greens, melon, radish Up to 4 Years: eggplant, squash, tomato Up to 3 Years: beans, peas, cabbage and carrot family varieties Up to 2 Years: leek, mesclun, sweet corn Up to 1 Year: lettuce, onion "],

A person or group that is self sufficient is able to provide themselves with what is necessary with little help from others. Examples: people living in a remote wilderness; people doing an expedition into mountain or ocean environments; astronauts in space. What does the term “ancestral Pueblo people” mean? An ancient Native American culture that spanned the present-day Four Corners region of the United States; the ancestors of today’s Pueblo tribes of Arizona and New Mexico. Ancestral Pueblo people were very skilled at self sufficiency. Their material culture and their lifeways reflect the innovations and adaptations they developed to survive in a isolated and challenging desert environment. They were resilient.

Masaw warned the clan people that the life he had to offer them was very different from what they had before. To show them that life, Ma’saw gave the people a planting stick (So’ya), a bag of seeds and a gourd of water. He handed them a small ear of blue corn and told them, “Here is my life and spirit. This is what I give you.” – (Wall and Masayesva 2004:435–436) Introduce students to the corn varieties and explore their diversity in size, color, endosperm texture (use a diagram of a corn kernel at this time). Show students the digging stick and gourd and circulate them, along with the corn seed. Allow students to handle and observe them. Procedure: Divide students into small discussion groups of 3 to 5 students and rearrange their seating so they are sitting in small discussion circles. Count-off the groups, from 1 to 3, to assign each of them a discussion question number. Read aloud each of the discussion questions to the corresponding groups. Each group should nominate and indicate to the instructor who will be their “Scribe”: the person who will begin the discussion by rereading the discussion question to the group, and then record the group’s answers, to share with the class. Hand out the correct discussion question sheet and a pen to each scribe. For a total of approximately 5 minutes, groups should discuss their discussion question and report back on their ideas. After about 2 minutes, give the groups a time-check and a reminder: scribes need to record at least a few complete sentence answers to share. At this time, scribes should re-read their discussion question to their group to ensure the discussion is still focused and relevant. Come back together as a group. The “scribe” from each group shares their group’s ideas with the class. The instructor helps to connect the students’ answers with the information presented below, to help them draw conclusions from their group’s ideas. Question #1: Without direct instructions from the Guardian Spirit, Masaw, how did the first Hopi farmers learn how to dryland farm in the southwest? Through years of trial and error, agricultural experiments, and long-term observations, they became experts at: Understanding plant and animal behavior Knowing soil types and measuring moisture content Predicting weather patterns Predicting and directing water runoff Question #2: Why is corn, in particular, so important to every aspect of traditional Hopi life? How is corn and agriculture viewed in our modern culture? Corn farming in a drought prone environment is difficult. Helping corn plants to survive becomes a metaphor for how people can survive, as life is often difficult. Dryland corn farming teaches Hopi people the value of patience, humility, respect and cooperation. Hopi and Ancestral Pueblo people grew food for their own survival. They knew exactly how their food was grown and where it came from. Modern agriculture has disconnected many modern people from an awareness of where and how their food is grown or produced. Many modern people expect their food to be delivered to their towns and houses, already processed, preserved and packaged. Many modern farmers view corn as a large scale cash crop; they know that, to produce most corn today, a large water supply (irrigation), fertilizers, and machinery are required. Question #3: After examining the different kinds of Hopi corn, why do you think there are so many varieties of traditional corn? What are some of the threats from GMO corn on Hopi corn? Genes provide the instructions to build a living thing. If you change one of the genes, you rewrite the instructions. Humans have been manipulating the genes of plants for 10,000 years, without harming ecosystems or humans, in a process called breeding—mixing and matching the characteristics found within one species of plant. It has resulted in an increase in diversity in crop plants, benefiting human health and increasing the chance that communities will survive environmental challenges like drought. Diversity is important when growing crops in challenging environments, such as the Hopi do. The Hopi people have survived on their land in part because they have bred over 17 different named varieties of corn, each with special talents for adapting and overcoming threats like drought, and excelling at essential skills like long-term storage. GMO: this acronym stands for Genetically Modified Organism. They are created by mixing genes from very different species in order to meet a need or fix a problem in agriculture such as resisting disease and pests, surviving frost and drought. The difference between genetically modifying plants and breeding them: Breeding crops: plant species’ genes are changed over thousands of years Genetically modifying crops: plant species’ genes are changed when a gene, sometimes from a non-plant species, is inserted to create a new species that has never before existed on Earth and arrives almost overnight without evolving alongside its environment. It is hard to control or predict the mixing of genes plants. Once GMOs are involved, unintended consequences can result. The impacts of GMO seed on traditional crops and ecosystems are being actively studied by agricultural scientists. In the meantime, the Hopi must protect their corn’s genes from mixing with genetically modified genes. They must protect the purity of the corn varieties that are at the center of their culture. Heirloom or Ancient Crops and Seeds Increased Diversity in Corn Seed saving provides free, environment-adapted seeds every year GMO Crops and Seeds Decreased Diversity in Corn Seed saving can’t be done; seed that is not environment-adapted must be bought every year With students remaining seated with their small discussion groups, survey students’ understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students, while steering the discussion to toward the answers listed below the question. Introduce students to the term self-sufficiency by writing it on the whiteboard and reading it aloud. Have students work in small groups of three or four students to discuss the meaning of self-sufficiency. Invite each group to share with the class while guiding the discussion toward the the following definition: A person or group that is self sufficient is able to provide themselves with what is necessary with little help from others. Examples: people living in a remote wilderness; people doing an expedition into mountain or ocean environments; astronauts in space. Ask students the following questions and record their responses on the whiteboard: How will humans achieve self sufficiency in the future? For example, how will we make sure we are able to feed the human population as it increases and the health of the planet decreases? Point out that being self sufficient on planet Earth requires that we: know our history (how we have taken care of ourselves in the past) carefully craft innovative solutions (how we will take care of ourselves in the future) Have students work in groups of three or four to engage in a discussion about each of the following questions. Present each question one at a time and allow no more than two minutes of discussion per question Do you live in an isolated place? What would happen if the town you live in were cut off from receiving food from outside sources? How many roads lead to your hometown? What kind of events could (or have in the past) destroyed or blocked these roads? Flash floods, mudslides, road construction dynamite, wildfires. An important aspect of self sufficiency is food. How does your town stock the shelves of the grocery stores? Food is delivered by transport trucks. Towns like Cortez could quickly become isolated from receiving food and materials from outside sources. What does it mean to have “food security”? A community has “food security” when safe, nutritious food is available without people or food having to travel great distances. Students return to working with their small discussion groups. Outline the final activity: Each group will work as a team to make Space Travel Self-Sufficiency Plan based on the following hypothetical scenario (read aloud): Healthy human life on Earth is no longer possible due to environmental damage. All humans will leave in fleets of spacecraft where they plan to live for 50 human generations or 1000 years. Each spaceship has a population of people that must act as a community. Each community is named after their ship. The first ship to leave will be “Discovery One”. It will establish the “Discovery One” community. Each community must decide what what is essential to take with them from among the objects and technologies that currently exist. Each student group will work together as a spacecraft community for 15 minutes. Distribute to each a piece of chart paper and a marker. During this time, the instructor aids the groups by being a timekeeper. They must accomplish the following tasks to prepare for their escape from Earth: Decide on a name for their ship/community (1 minute) Decide which community member will be: (2 minutes) “The Scribe”: a person with good handwriting and drawing skills and will draw, write and speak for the group, reading their plan aloud at the end. “The Checker”: a person who asks good questions and can focus the discussion on the most important questions about survival. Being guided by The Scribe and The Checker, the groups draw a large, basic outline of a spaceship that takes up most of the chart paper. The scribe fills the outline with words that describe items or technologies they want to bring. (5 minutes) At the halfway point in the groups’ work time (approximately 8 minutes into group work time), briefly regroup as a class, and give the students the following clarifications: 6th grade: encourage students to focus on items that will create systems that resemble healthy ecosystems. Remind all groups that they cannot include any technology or inventions that have yet to be invented. 7th &amp; 8th grade: Review the concept that the water cycle is a closed system. Inform students that the items they bring should account for this and other closed systems, like trash/compost/waste, in their spacecraft. Remind all groups that they cannot include any technology or inventions that have yet to be invented. Students resume planning and make changes to their spacecraft to account for these ideas. (approximately 7 minutes). Closing Circle Invite each group to present their plan of self-sufficiency to the class. Have any of the groups made the connection between their spacecraft and the actual planet Earth we live on? Our spaceship is called Planet Earth. Read the following statement: We are already living on a spacecraft; the Earth is spinning through space holding human communities. We are separated from space by a thin layer of atmosphere; the distance from the surface of the planet to outer space is barely 60 miles. Earth is the only planet we know of that sustains human life, despite searching space for 60 years. Explain to students that many ancient cultures throughout the world have created agricultural practices that were sustainable and self-sufficient. Point out that over the next couple of weeks students will be learning about ancestral Pueblo people, their farming practices, and how these practices can inform our own sustainable relationship to the land. Engage students in a brief discussion to address the following questions: What does sustainability mean to you? Do the Hopi/Ancestral Pueblo people meet your ideas of sustainability? Students explain their opinions. Survey the students for their understanding of the following quote: “Indigenous education is really a ten thousand year strategic plan.” – Gregory Cajete There are 7.3 billion people riding along on spacecraft Planet Earth. We must COMBINE our ancestral agriculture techniques,materials and principles we relied on in the past WITH the innovative technologies and materials of the future.

A person or group that is self sufficient is able to provide themselves with what is necessary with little help from others. Examples: people living in a remote wilderness; people doing an expedition into mountain or ocean environments; astronauts in space. What does the term “ancestral Pueblo people” mean? An ancient Native American culture that spanned the present-day Four Corners region of the United States; the ancestors of today’s Pueblo tribes of Arizona and New Mexico. Ancestral Pueblo people were very skilled at self sufficiency. Their material culture and their lifeways reflect the innovations and adaptations they developed to survive in a isolated and challenging desert environment. They were resilient. Show students a map of the United States, and help them to identify the Four Corners region: Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.

Masaw warned the clan people that the life he had to offer them was very different from what they had before. To show them that life, Ma’saw gave the people a planting stick (So’ya), a bag of seeds and a gourd of water. He handed them a small ear of blue corn and told them, “Here is my life and spirit. This is what I give you.” – (Wall and Masayesva 2004:435–436) Introduce students to the corn varieties and explore their diversity in size, color, endosperm texture (use a diagram of a corn kernel at this time). Show students the digging stick and gourd and circulate them, along with the corn seed. Allow students to handle and observe them. Procedure: Divide students into small discussion groups of 3 to 5 students and rearrange their seating so they are sitting in small discussion circles. Count-off the groups, from 1 to 3, to assign each of them a discussion question number. Read aloud each of the discussion questions to the corresponding groups. Each group should nominate and indicate to the instructor who will be their “Scribe”: the person who will begin the discussion by rereading the discussion question to the group, and then record the group’s answers, to share with the class.

For example, how will we make sure we are able to feed the human population as it increases and the health of the planet decreases? Point out that being self sufficient on planet Earth requires that we: know our history (how we have taken care of ourselves in the past) carefully craft innovative solutions (how we will take care of ourselves in the future) Have students work in groups of three or four to engage in a discussion about each of the following questions. Present each question one at a time and allow no more than two minutes of discussion per question Do you live in an isolated place? What would happen if the town you live in were cut off from receiving food from outside sources? How many roads lead to your hometown? What kind of events could (or have in the past) destroyed or blocked these roads? Flash floods, mudslides, road construction dynamite, wildfires. An important aspect of self sufficiency is food. How does your town stock the shelves of the grocery stores? Food is delivered by transport trucks. Towns like Cortez could quickly become isolated from receiving food and materials from outside sources. What does it mean to have “food security”? A community has “food security” when safe, nutritious food is available without people or food having to travel great distances. Students return to working with their small discussion groups. Outline the final activity: Each group will work as a team to make Space Travel Self-Sufficiency Plan based on the following hypothetical scenario (read aloud): Healthy human life on Earth is no longer possible due to environmental damage. All humans will leave in fleets of spacecraft where they plan to live for 50 human generations or 1000 years. Each spaceship has a population of people that must act as a community. Each community is named after their ship. The first ship to leave will be “Discovery One”. It will establish the “Discovery One” community. Each community must decide what what is essential to take with them from among the objects and technologies that currently exist. Each student group will work together as a spacecraft community for 15 minutes. Distribute to each a piece of chart paper and a marker. During this time, the instructor aids the groups by being a timekeeper. They must accomplish the following tasks to prepare for their escape from Earth: Decide on a name for their ship/community (1 minute) Decide which community member will be: (2 minutes) “The Scribe”: a person with good handwriting and drawing skills and will draw, write and speak for the group, reading their plan aloud at the end. “The Checker”: a person who asks good questions and can focus the discussion on the most important questions about survival. Being guided by The Scribe and The Checker, the groups draw a large, basic outline of a spaceship that takes up most of the chart paper. The scribe fills the outline with words that describe items or technologies they want to bring. (5 minutes) At the halfway point in the groups’ work time (approximately 8 minutes into group work time), briefly regroup as a class, and give the students the following clarifications: 6th grade: encourage students to focus on items that will create systems that resemble healthy ecosystems. Remind all groups that they cannot include any technology or inventions that have yet to be invented. 7th &amp; 8th grade: Review the concept that the water cycle is a closed system. Inform students that the items they bring should account for this and other closed systems, like trash/compost/waste, in their spacecraft. Remind all groups that they cannot include any technology or inventions that have yet to be invented. Students resume planning and make changes to their spacecraft to account for these ideas. (approximately 7 minutes). Closing Circle Invite each group to present their plan of self-sufficiency to the class. Have any of the groups made the connection between their spacecraft and the actual planet Earth we live on? Our spaceship is called Planet Earth. Read the following statement: We are already living on a spacecraft; the Earth is spinning through space holding human communities. We are separated from space by a thin layer of atmosphere; the distance from the surface of the planet to outer space is barely 60 miles. Earth is the only planet we know of that sustains human life, despite searching space for 60 years. Explain to students that many ancient cultures throughout the world have created agricultural practices that were sustainable and self-sufficient. Point out that over the next couple of weeks students will be learning about ancestral Pueblo people, their farming practices, and how these practices can inform our own sustainable relationship to the land. Engage students in a brief discussion to address the following questions: What does sustainability mean to you? Do the Hopi/Ancestral Pueblo people meet your ideas of sustainability? Students explain their opinions. Survey the students for their understanding of the following quote: “Indigenous education is really a ten thousand year strategic plan.” — Gregory Cajete There are 7.3 billion people riding along on spacecraft Planet Earth.

Briefly gather input from the students, while steering the discussion to toward the answers listed below the question. What is the definition of self-sufficiency? A person or group that is self sufficient is able to provide themselves with what is necessary with little help from others. Examples: people living in a remote wilderness; people doing an expedition into mountain or ocean environments; astronauts in space. What does the term “ancestral Pueblo people” mean? An ancient Native American culture that spanned the present-day Four Corners region of the United States; the ancestors of today’s Pueblo tribes of Arizona and New Mexico. Ancestral Pueblo people were very skilled at self sufficiency. Their material culture and their lifeways reflect the innovations and adaptations they developed to survive in a isolated and challenging desert environment. They were resilient. Show students a map of the United States, and help them to identify the Four Corners region: Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.

Masaw warned the clan people that the life he had to offer them was very different from what they had before. To show them that life, Ma’saw gave the people a planting stick (So’ya), a bag of seeds and a gourd of water. He handed them a small ear of blue corn and told them, “Here is my life and spirit. This is what I give you.” – (Wall and Masayesva 2004:435–436) Introduce students to the corn varieties and explore their diversity in size, color, endosperm texture (use a diagram of a corn kernel at this time). Show students the digging stick and gourd and circulate them, along with the corn seed. Allow students to handle and observe them. Procedure: Divide students into small discussion groups of 3 to 5 students and rearrange their seating so they are sitting in small discussion circles. Count-off the groups, from 1 to 3, to assign each of them a discussion question number. Read aloud each of the discussion questions to the corresponding groups. Each group should nominate and indicate to the instructor who will be their “Scribe”: the person who will begin the discussion by rereading the discussion question to the group, and then record the group’s answers, to share with the class. Hand out the correct discussion question sheet and a pen to each scribe. For a total of approximately 5 minutes, groups should discuss their discussion question and report back on their ideas. After about 2 minutes, give the groups a time-check and a reminder: scribes need to record at least a few complete sentence answers to share. At this time, scribes should re-read their discussion question to their group to ensure the discussion is still focused and relevant. Come back together as a group. The “scribe” from each group shares their group’s ideas with the class. The instructor helps to connect the students’ answers with the information presented below, to help them draw conclusions from their group’s ideas. Question #1: Without direct instructions from the Guardian Spirit, Masaw, how did the first Hopi farmers learn how to dryland farm in the southwest? Through years of trial and error, agricultural experiments, and long-term observations, they became experts at: Understanding plant and animal behavior Knowing soil types and measuring moisture content Predicting weather patterns Predicting and directing water runoff Question #2: Why is corn, in particular, so important to every aspect of traditional Hopi life? How is corn and agriculture viewed in our modern culture? Corn farming in a drought prone environment is difficult. Helping corn plants to survive becomes a metaphor for how people can survive, as life is often difficult. Dryland corn farming teaches Hopi people the value of patience, humility, respect and cooperation. Hopi and Ancestral Pueblo people grew food for their own survival. They knew exactly how their food was grown and where it came from. Modern agriculture has disconnected many modern people from an awareness of where and how their food is grown or produced. Many modern people expect their food to be delivered to their towns and houses, already processed, preserved and packaged. Many modern farmers view corn as a large scale cash crop; they know that, to produce most corn today, a large water supply (irrigation), fertilizers, and machinery are required. Question #3: After examining the different kinds of Hopi corn, why do you think there are so many varieties of traditional corn? What are some of the threats from GMO corn on Hopi corn? Genes provide the instructions to build a living thing. If you change one of the genes, you rewrite the instructions. Humans have been manipulating the genes of plants for 10,000 years, without harming ecosystems or humans, in a process called breeding—mixing and matching the characteristics found within one species of plant. It has resulted in an increase in diversity in crop plants, benefiting human health and increasing the chance that communities will survive environmental challenges like drought. Diversity is important when growing crops in challenging environments, such as the Hopi do. The Hopi people have survived on their land in part because they have bred over 17 different named varieties of corn, each with special talents for adapting and overcoming threats like drought, and excelling at essential skills like long-term storage. GMO: this acronym stands for Genetically Modified Organism. They are created by mixing genes from very different species in order to meet a need or fix a problem in agriculture such as resisting disease and pests, surviving frost and drought. The difference between genetically modifying plants and breeding them: Breeding crops: plant species’ genes are changed over thousands of years Genetically modifying crops: plant species’ genes are changed when a gene, sometimes from a non-plant species, is inserted to create a new species that has never before existed on Earth and arrives almost overnight without evolving alongside its environment. It is hard to control or predict the mixing of genes plants. Once GMOs are involved, unintended consequences can result. The impacts of GMO seed on traditional crops and ecosystems are being actively studied by agricultural scientists. In the meantime, the Hopi must protect their corn’s genes from mixing with genetically modified genes. They must protect the purity of the corn varieties that are at the center of their culture. Heirloom or Ancient Crops and Seeds Increased Diversity in Corn Seed saving provides free, environment-adapted seeds every year GMO Crops and Seeds Decreased Diversity in Corn Seed saving can’t be done; seed that is not environment-adapted must be bought every year Closing Circle: (5 minutes) Engage students in a brief discussion to address the following questions: What does sustainability mean to you?

Handout: Traditional Hopi planting techniques Traditional Hopi planting techniques for Dryland Farming of Corn Spacing is an important consideration for plant health, root development and good pollination. Unlike the conventional practice of planting seeds in a row and measuring the space between seeds, the Hopi plant several seeds together in a clump and pace off, with measured steps, the space between clumps. Spacing in a Hopi garden is 2–3 adult paces/steps, or 4–6 feet, between clumps. Widely spaced plant clumps creates groups of reservoirs of moisture for each clump. To plant, the ground is first scraped with the hands or the side of the foot to remove dust/loose top soil on the surface to the depth of hardpan or compacted soil. The soil that comes out of the hole must not be tossed far away from the opening. It must be pulled back only as far as necessary. This creates a 2x2 foot basin. In the center of the basin, the digging stick, or so’ya is used to create a hole. The correct depth of the hole is reached when the soil’s moisture can be seen and felt. The hole should be the shape of a cone, no wider than 4 inches, and 6–10 inches deep. About 12 seeds are planted into each hole. Later, when the plants are approximately 1 foot tall, the clump is thinned to about 6 plants. The soil must be placed back in the hole in same order that it was removed: the moist soil that was the last to be removed is the first to be returned. To finish, some of the loose topsoil from the edge of the basin is brushed and scattered over the filled-in hole. This creates a “dust mulch” that seals in moisture. Two to three adult paces/steps are taken to the next planting clump location. Traditional Hopi planting techniques for Dryland Farming of Bean, Squash and Melon Repeat step #2 from Corn Planting Techniques, with the exception that the basin created is only 1x1 foot. These varieties are planted deep enough that each seed is surrounded by moist soil, approximately 5–7 inches deep. Four to five seeds are planted in each hole. Later, when the plants are approximately 6 inches tall, the clump is thinned to 2 plants. To finish, some of the loose topsoil from the edge of the basin is used as a dust mulch to cover the hole. One adult pace/step is taken to the next planting location. Traditionally these varieties are planted in separate areas but could be interplanted between corn clumps. "],

Long Session Long Session: Traditional Dryland Farming Format: One approximately 90 minute session Opening Circle: Questions and Discussion Survey students’ understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students, while steering the discussion toward the answers listed below the question. Where does soil come from? View the video clip: &quot; The Symphony of Soil“: minute 0:00–7:57. Soil is made of a combination of minerals, organic matter and sand. These three ingredients are combined in different amounts and travel long distances around the globe through the movements of glaciers, water and wind. How does soil gain water? View the video clip: Minute 0:00–3:32 of The Monsoon Project Using the water cycle diagram, help students locate precipitation in the cycle. Water is delivered to the soil in two ways: The Earth’s Water Cycle: precipitation in the form of rain, snow and ice. In the Southwest, the most important weather events that deliver water to the soil are winter snowstorms and summer monsoon rains. Humans capture and store water from the water cycle and spread it on the soil using irrigation systems. How does soil lose water? Using the water cycle diagram, help students locate transpiration and evaporation in the cycle. The soil loses water through a process called evapotranspiration. This means the soil loses moisture through direct evaporation and through plant tissues, due to the wind and the sun. Breaking this term into two parts helps reveal this definition: Transpiration — plants sweat out and lose water they have received from the soil Evaporation — the soil loses water due to the wind and the sun To slow this process down, farmers use a technique called mulching. Mulch is: a material that is spread over a planting area, protecting the soil from the effects of the wind and the sun. a layer of insulation that traps moisture and shades the soil, preventing the water in the soil from evaporating. Carbon-based materials such as straw or dry grass clippings. Pueblo farmers, such as the Hopi, use dust and sand as a mulch; they covered the moist soil that held their seeds with a thick layer of sand and dust. Why do some farmers apply irrigation water to their soil? Some farmers irrigate because: they are replacing the water that their plants and soil have lost to evapotranspiration. Some plants require more water than the environment has to offer; the farmers apply irrigation water to make up for water that does not arrive in the form of rain and snow. Some modern farmers do not apply irrigation water to their soil: Hopi farmers who have vast dryland corn fields farmers from the western states who have large dryland crop farms. Hopi and other dryland farmers do not use irrigation systems; the keys to their success is understanding weather patterns, caring for their soil, planting drought-resilient seeds and having faith in natural cycles. “Dry-farming in the high desert….relying only on precipitation and runoff water, requires an almost miraculous level of faith and is sustained by hard work, prayer, and an attitude of deep humility.” — Wall and Masayesva 2004:436 How do dryland farmers decide where to place their gardens and fields? Why is this decision so important? List the following features on the whiteboard, gather student input, and clarify with simple geographic drawings. Choosing the location of a garden is called “site selection”. It is important to dryland farming because the chosen site must be able to capture and hold water delivered by the Water Cycle, making it “drought-resilient”. These are the features that the ancestral Pueblo farmers of the past and the Hopi dryland farmers of today look for in a site that will be drought-resilient: Geography: Water that drains off of a mesa or cliff will collect and flood down into drainages, washes, arroyos or canyons. Where these features become less narrow and open up into sandy slopes, Pueblo farmers expect water and good soil to collect because it is washed down with the floodwaters. This mouth or opening is also a place where they traditionally built check dams: rows of low rock walls to slow down the movement of runoff water. Garden slope: North-facing slopes have more shade, therefore less water is lost to evaporation. Indicator plants: The appearance of certain plants in early spring give information, or indicate, to Hopi and other Dryland farmers about where the best places are for a garden/field, how deep to plant and how much space to leave between plants. Farmers combine these indications with practice, experience and knowledge of the land. Some examples of plants that indicate these conditions are: CONDITION INDICATOR PLANT Good soil moisture Rabbitbrush Four-wing saltbrush Mormon tea Rice grass Snakeweed Deep, well drained soil Rabbitbrush Oak trees Soil moisture depth: deep, soft soils that allows natural reservoirs of water to collect in and be held deep in the soil. Soil color: darker colors often mean higher amounts of decomposed organic matter and nutrients in the soil. In the Southwest, this means dark red-brown. Large, open planting area: the area must be large enough that clumps of seeds can be planted with wide spaces between them (2-3 adult paces/steps or 4 - 6 feet, between clumps.) This spacing allows little soil-moisture reservoirs to be created between clumps, providing long-term moisture. When a normal amount of snow and rain does not arrive year after year, this is called a “drought”. How did ancestral Puebloan farmers respond to drought? The Hopi people of today continue to use the agricultural knowledge gained through their ancestral dryland farming practices. They want to ensure their crops will continue to be drought-resilient into the future.**_ _**To survive drought, a dryland farmer must know a lot about their soil and their seeds. Ancestral Pueblo farmers responded to drought by: anticipating the possibility that it could arrive any year, and preparing for it by saving seeds from plants that can survive drought. using the site selection factors listed above as test questions to decide whether or not a site will be drought-resilient. meeting these site requirements by planting in multiple locations. using clumps of plants at the edge of the planting area, or tin cans placed around seedlings, as a windbreak to decrease evapotranspiration. Covering holes that contain seeds with loose topsoil to act as a “dust mulch”. Do modern dryland farmers use any of these same practices? Yes, however, in modern fields, there is an emphasis on knowing the soil through soil testing: First, farmers learn what is in their soil to determine what kind of soil they have. Second, farmers find out how much water their soil can hold. If the soil receives more water than it can hold, much of the extra water will drain away. Water that is wasted in this way is called runoff; it leads to erosion, when soil is carried away by the runoff. During this class, we will conduct soil testing experiments as well as practice using the Pueblo farmers’ site selection test questions. Procedure Divide the students into five working groups to complete soil and site selection tests/ experiments. Groups 1–3 will practice using modern soil tests. Groups 3 and 4 will practice using the Puebloan site selection test questions. Group 1: Create a Soil Particle Demonstration jar by following the procedure in Garden Notes #214: Estimating Soil Texture, page 214-3. Group 2: Perform Feel, Ball and Ribbon Tests by following the procedure in Garden Notes #214: Estimating Soil Texture, page 214-5. Conduct this test in two different locations: one where plant growth is vigorous and one where plant growth is weak. Use the tests to compare and contrast the soil from each site. Group 3: Perform Water Holding Capacity Test using the attached handout.. Group 4: Assess an established growing area, using the Site Selection Test Question Handout using the attached handout. Group 5: Look for and assess a possible new growing area using the Site Selection Test Question Handout using the attached handout. Closing Circle Report-Back: A representative from each group shares their group’s findings. Reflective writing time: Present two of the three following free-writing topics for students to choose from. Give students 7 - 10 minutes to choose a topic and write a free form answer that reflects who they are/what they value, as a young adult. Which soil testing methods align most with their worldview? List the ways/reasons they feel connected with corn plants or soil: the shape, appearance, colors? What do you think about, feel or remember when holding corn kernels in your hands or hearing the sound of wind moving through the garden? Hopi corn, and other ancient grains are still grown today because they have survived and grown resiliently through challenging weather, and because humans cared for them and saved their seeds. What makes you resilient? What do you do to make sure you survive through all kinds of weather/situations? Short Session 1 Short Session 1: Know Your Soil!

Breaking this term into two parts helps reveal this definition: Transpiration — plants sweat out and lose water they have received from the soil Evaporation — the soil loses water due to the wind and the sun To slow this process down, farmers use a technique called mulching. Mulch is: a material that is spread over a planting area, protecting the soil from the effects of the wind and the sun. a layer of insulation that traps moisture and shades the soil, preventing the water in the soil from evaporating. Carbon-based materials such as straw or dry grass clippings. Pueblo farmers, such as the Hopi, use dust and sand as a mulch; they covered the moist soil that held their seeds with a thick layer of sand and dust. Why do some farmers apply irrigation water to their soil? Some farmers irrigate because: they are replacing the water that their plants and soil have lost to evapotranspiration. Some plants require more water than the environment has to offer; the farmers apply irrigation water to make up for water that does not arrive in the form of rain and snow. Some modern farmers do not apply irrigation water to their soil: Hopi farmers who have vast dryland corn fields farmers from the western states who have large dryland crop farms. Procedure Divide the students into working groups of four or five students to complete soil tests/ experiments. Group 1: Create a Soil Particle Demonstration jar by following the procedure in Garden Notes #214: Estimating Soil Texture, page 214-3. Group 2: Perform Feel, Ball and Ribbon Tests by following the procedure in Garden Notes #214: Estimating Soil Texture, page 214-5. Conduct this test in two different locations: one where plant growth is vigorous and one where plant growth is weak. Use the tests to compare and contrast the soil from each site. Group 3: Perform Water Holding Capacity Test using the attached handout. Closing Circle Report-Back: A representative from each group shares their group’s findings. Reflective writing time: If time allows, present the following free-writing topics for students to choose from. Give students 5 - 7 minutes to choose a topic and write a free form answer that reflects who they are/what they value, as a young adult. Which soil testing methods align most with their worldview? List the ways/reasons they feel connected with corn plants or soil: the shape, appearance, colors? What do you think about, feel or remember when holding corn kernels in your hands or hearing the sound of wind moving through the garden? Short Session 2 Short Session 2: Soil and Site Selection Format: One approximately 45 minute session Opening Circle: Questions and Discussion Review with students the discussion from the previous day regarding soil and irrigation. Explain that Hopi and other dryland farmers do not use irrigation systems; the keys to their success is understanding weather patterns, caring for their soil, planting drought-resilient seeds and having faith in natural cycles. Survey students’ understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students, while steering the discussion toward the answers listed below the question. “Dry-farming in the high desert….relying only on precipitation and runoff water, requires an almost miraculous level of faith and is sustained by hard work, prayer, and an attitude of deep humility.” — Wall and Masayesva 2004:436 How do dryland farmers decide where to place their gardens and fields? Why is this decision so important? List the following features on the whiteboard, gather student input, and clarify with simple geographic drawings. Choosing the location of a garden is called “site selection”. It is important to dryland farming because the chosen site must be able to capture and hold water delivered by the Water Cycle, making it “drought-resilient”. These are the features that the ancestral Pueblo farmers of the past and the Hopi dryland farmers of today look for in a site that will be drought-resilient: Geography: Water that drains off of a mesa or cliff will collect and flood down into drainages, washes, arroyos or canyons. Where these features become less narrow and open up into sandy slopes, Pueblo farmers expect water and good soil to collect because it is washed down with the floodwaters. This mouth or opening is also a place where they traditionally built check dams: rows of low rock walls to slow down the movement of runoff water. Garden slope: North-facing slopes have more shade, therefore less water is lost to evaporation. Indicator plants: The appearance of certain plants in early spring give information, or indicate, to Hopi and other Dryland farmers about where the best places are for a garden/field, how deep to plant and how much space to leave between plants. Farmers combine these indications with practice, experience and knowledge of the land. Some examples of plants that indicate these conditions are: CONDITION INDICATOR PLANT Good soil moisture Rabbitbrush Four-wing saltbrush Mormon tea Rice grass Snakeweed Deep, well drained soil Rabbitbrush Oak trees Soil moisture depth: deep, soft soils that allows natural reservoirs of water to collect in and be held deep in the soil. Soil color: darker colors often mean higher amounts of decomposed organic matter and nutrients in the soil. In the Southwest, this means dark red-brown. Large, open planting area: the area must be large enough that clumps of seeds can be planted with wide spaces between them (2-3 adult paces/steps or 4 - 6 feet, between clumps.) This spacing allows little soil-moisture reservoirs to be created between clumps, providing long-term moisture. When a normal amount of snow and rain does not arrive year after year, this is called a “drought”. How did ancestral Puebloan farmers respond to drought? The Hopi people of today continue to use the agricultural knowledge gained through their ancestral dryland farming practices. They want to ensure their crops will continue to be drought-resilient into the future.**_ _**To survive drought, a dryland farmer must know a lot about their soil and their seeds. Ancestral Pueblo farmers responded to drought by: anticipating the possibility that it could arrive any year, and preparing for it by saving seeds from plants that can survive drought. using the site selection factors listed above as test questions to decide whether or not a site will be drought-resilient. meeting these site requirements by planting in multiple locations. using clumps of plants at the edge of the planting area, or tin cans placed around seedlings, as a windbreak to decrease evapotranspiration. Covering holes that contain seeds with loose topsoil to act as a “dust mulch”. Do modern dryland farmers use any of these same practices? Yes, however, in modern fields, there is an emphasis on knowing the soil through soil testing: First, farmers learn what is in their soil to determine what kind of soil they have. Second, farmers find out how much water their soil can hold. If the soil receives more water than it can hold, much of the extra water will drain away. Water that is wasted in this way is called runoff; it leads to erosion, when soil is carried away by the runoff. During this class, we will conduct soil testing experiments as well as practice using the Pueblo farmers’ site selection test questions. Procedure Divide the students into small working groups and assign each group one of the following tasks: Group 1: Assess an established growing area, using the Site Selection Test Question Handout using the attached handout. Group 2: Look for and assess a possible new growing area using the Site Selection Test Question Handout using the attached handout.

Session Short Session: How a Digging Stick Feeds a Family Format: One approximately 45 minute session Opening Circle: Questions and Discussion Survey students’ understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students, while steering the discussion to toward the answers listed below the question. Families feed themselves in many different ways. In your family, who is responsible for calculating the available money and the groceries needed? Now imagine, instead, your family calculated how many corn plants and how much land was needed. Read the following aloud: Traditionally, in the Hopi culture, the women are responsible for calculating and keeping track of each year’s planting needs, in order to have enough food for the community in coming year. They are responsible for drying and storing seeds from the previous year, ensuring that there is enough corn for both food and ceremony. These are skills and knowledge that the women pass on to their daughters, nieces and grandchildren. Based on the women’s calculations, the men identify and prepare corn field locations, request and receive the correct amount of seed from the women and are responsible for planting the seeds. — Wall and Masayesva 2004 During this lesson, we will answer these questions (write on whiteboard): How much corn would you need to feed yourself and your family for one year? How much field space would be needed to plant this amount of corn? Procedure In order to answer these questions, the class will be working through a math narrative as a group. The calculations will be used to estimate: the amount of calories (gained from corn) one traditional Hopi family would eat in one year. the number of corn plants a Hopi family would need for food and for ceremonies in one year. the amount of field space needed to plant this number of corn plants. To provide context for the math narrative, read the this description, and the following question, to the group: A traditional Hopi farmer married to a Hopi woman does not plant for himself but for his wife’s family. Each year before planting begins his wife advises him on the quantities and types of corn needed to provide for the food and ceremonial needs of her family and perhaps others as well. The man in turn tells his wife how many gunnysacks of each type of corn seed that he will need to plant his fields, and she prepares them….(she) must have a clear sense of these varied needs and how best to satisfy them in the coming harvest. Her understanding of the different needs for corn requires intimate knowledge of Hopi culture and religious and ceremonial practice. A woman who can determine the quantities and types of corn needed for the coming year holds a bounty of general knowledge of the Hopi way. — Wall and Masayesva 2004:443 The Hopi people of today grow corn, squash, beans and melons, providing themselves with one third of their diet. Their ancestors grew the same crops, but gained as much as 75% of their diet from corn. All of the corn seed was traditionally planted using the so’ya digging stick (review “Diagram 1: A Planting Hole in a Hopi Maize Field”.) If your diet was 75% corn, how much corn would you need to plant, and grow successfully, in order to feed yourself and your family for one year? Working as a group to determine the answer to this question, students should be organized into pairs to share a calculator but each using their own journal to record the calculations developed on the whiteboard. Using the whiteboard space efficiently, use the **“Calculations Group Equation Sequence**&quot; page: Pose all text and questions, written in italics, verbally to the group. Write the bolded questions on the whiteboard. Write the equations that correspond to the question on the board,in a tidy column.

Be sure to write out the equations exactly as they appear on the “Calculations Group Equation Sequence” page, with their associated units of measure, so that students do not lose sight of the question or the meaning of the answers. Closing Circle Conclusions from the Math Narrative: How much corn would you need to feed a family for one year? 902,720 grams, or 11,284 ears How many clumps of corn would that take? 1,128 clumps How much field space would need to be planted, using only a so’ya/digging stick, to grow that number of clumps of corn? 4,512 square meters CO Standards This lesson plan was designed to align with the following Montezuma School to Farm Project Garden Education Standards and state Of Colorado Academic Standards: Montezuma School to Farm Project’s Garden Education Standards Colorado Academic Standards 6th Intro to garden mapping and planning.

Write out the equations exactly as they appear, with their associated units of measure. How much corn would you need to feed yourself and your family for one year? To have a healthy body, a person needs to eat about 2000 calories (Cal) each day. If you came from an ancestral Pueblo household, 75% of the food you ate every day came from corn. This would mean that you get 75% of your calories from corn. How many grams of corn would each person need to eat each day to fulfill 75% of their diet? What is 75% of 2000 calories? \\[2000 \\text{ Cal} \\times 0.75 = 1500 \\text{ Cal}\\] 1500 daily calories would come from corn, per person. How many grams of dried whole kernels of corn would give you 1500 calories, if we know that 100 grams of dried whole kernel corn provides approximately 375 calories? \\[1500 \\text{ Cal} \\div 375 \\text{ Cal} = 4\\] \\[4 \\times 100 \\text{ grams} = 400 \\text{ grams}\\] This means you would need to eat 100 grams of corn four times each day to reach 1500 calories. 400 grams of corn need to be eaten by each person in the household everyday, for them to gain 1500 calories. Show the students four 100 gram bags. How many grams of corn kernels would be needed for food by a household every day? Survey the students: How many people eat meals at your home on any given day? Calculate the average number of people in a household, as represented by this student group. The calculations below have used an average of 4 people per household. How many grams of corn kernels are needed to feed a household of four people, per day? Remember, these grams of food (made from corn) would come from plants you grow, on dryland farms, not from food bought at the store. And, it is only 75% of the food needed for the day; for example, we can think of 1600 grams as providing for breakfast and lunch not dinner. Multiply the answer to Question A X 400 grams to find the number of grams of corn kernels needed everyday by the household. \\[ 4 \\text{ persons} \\times \\frac{400 \\text{ grams}}{1 \\text{ person}} = 1600 \\text{ grams}\\] 1600 grams of corn kernels are needed by a household of four people every day. How many grams of corn kernels are needed for food by this household every year? Multiply the answer to Question B X 7 days in a week. \\[\\frac{1600\\text{ grams}}{1\\text{ day}}\\times\\frac{7\\text{ days}}{1\\text{ week}}=\\frac{11200\\text{ grams}}{1 \\text{ week}}\\] 11,200 grams of corn kernels are needed by a household of four people every week.

In a Hopi household, an additional 5% more corn is needed for days of ceremony, holidays and feasts. For example:, a wedding, a birth. Multiply the answer to Question D X 5% or 0.05: \\[\\frac{582400\\text{ grams}}{1\\text{ year}}\\times0.05=\\frac{29120\\text{ grams}}{1 \\text{ year}}\\] 29,120 grams of extra corn kernels are needed by a household of four people every year for ceremonies, holidays and feasts. In a Hopi household, an additional 50% more corn is grown in order to stock up on seed for the future and to prepare for drought years. Multiply the answer to Question D X 50% or 0.50: \\[\\frac{582400\\text{ grams}}{1\\text{ year}}\\times0.5=\\frac{291200 \\text{ grams}}{1 \\text{ year}}\\] 291,200 grams of extra corn kernels are needed by a household of four people every year for seed stock. Add the answers to Questions D + E + F to find the total number of grams of corn you must grow each year to provide for the needs of a Hopi family of four people. \\[\\frac{582400\\text{ grams}}{1\\text{ year}}+\\frac{29120\\text{ grams}}{1\\text{ year}}+\\frac{291200\\text{ grams}}{1\\text{ year}}=\\frac{902720 \\text{ grams}}{1 \\text{ year}}\\] 902,720 grams of corn kernels are needed by a household of four people every year. How many ears of corn would provide this many grams of corn kernels? 1.25 ears of corn has an average of 100 grams of whole kernels. Multiply the answer to Question G X 1.25 ears per 100 grams: \\[\\frac{902720\\text{ grams}}{1\\text{ year}}\\times\\frac{1.25\\text{ ears}}{100\\text{ grams}}=\\frac{11284\\text{ ears}}{1 \\text{ year}}\\] 11,284 ears of corn are needed by a household of four people every year. How many corn plants would provide this many ears of corn? Each stalk of corn typically produces 2 ears. Multiply the answer to Question H by 1 plant per 2 ears: \\[\\frac{11284\\text{ ears}}{1\\text{ year}}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ plant}}{2\\text{ ears}}=\\frac{5642\\text{ plants}}{1 \\text{ year}}\\] 5,642 corn plants are needed by a household of four people every year. How many corn clumps would provide this many corn plants? Hopi people grow corn plants in clumps of approximately 5 corn plants each. Multiply the answer to Question I by 1 clump per 5 ears: \\[\\frac{5642\\text{ plants}}{1\\text{ year}}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ clump}}{5\\text{ plants}}=\\frac{1128\\text{ clumps}}{1 \\text{ year}}\\] 1,128 clumps are needed by a household of four people every year. How much field space would a family need to plant to have enough corn? Hopi people plant clumps approximately 2 meters (m) apart; each clump needs about 4 m2 of space.

Long Session Long Session: Creating Colorful Corn and Seed Saving for Resilience Format: One approximately 90 minute session Opening Circle Read the following bolded text aloud: Agriculture is an important part of culture. The way that people organize themselves around their domesticated plants teaches us a lot about their culture’s traditions and customs. The Hopi culture, and its connection to the corn plant, is a good example of this. Listen to this quote that describes the spiritual importance of corn to the Hopi culture: “Since the emergence, Hopis refer to this life as the fourth way. As the Hopi moved from the third to the fourth way of life, they were offered corn by Ma’saw (the Guardian Spirit). The other peoples took the largest ears of corn and Hopis were left with the short blue ear. Each clan history explains how the Hopi received the short blue ear. The Hopis knew that their fourth way of life would be difficult and that they must submit to the corn as a way of life. The themes of humility, cooperation, respect, and universal earth stewardship became the way of life for all Hopis. In this way, the Hopi have always had corn and agriculture.” — Kuwanwisiwma 2005:16 The Hopi recognize many different varieties of corn. Most of these varieties were domesticated on Hopi land; a few were brought into the culture from outside of Hopi land. The Hopi have saved seeds from their domesticated plants for centuries in order to develop corn varieties that have many different special characteristics and colors. Understanding the process of seed saving begins with understanding how domesticated plants can be used for “breeding”. Survey students’ understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the following questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students, while steering the discussion toward the answers listed below the question. How did the Hopi people use domestication to create their beautifully colored corn varieties? Corn is a grain; when we eat it, we are eating the grains of a grass plant. About 9,000 years ago, people from a region near Mexico City began domesticating a wild grass plant called Teosinte. By planting it again and again in their garden spaces, they learned that they could breed the plants, which means encouraging plants with special qualities to mix their pollen, thereby sharing their genes with one another. The ancient people of Mexico bred teosinte plants until they had totally transformed them from a wild plant into a food crop. This process domesticated Teosinte and transformed it into corn. Domesticated corn arrived in the American Southwest region approximately 4,000 years ago. The Hopi continued breeding corn to create kernels of many colors, deepening the ways that corn holds and communicates Hopi culture/spirituality. What change in human lifestyle led to the need to domesticate corn and other plants? About 10,000 years ago humans became less nomadic (moving their settlements seasonally) and became settled (living in one place for a long period of time). Soon after settling, humans saw that it would be no longer possible to only gather wild plants to eat from around their settlement. These wild food plants would soon be too heavily harvested and would not grow back quickly enough to provide food for the settlement. Humans began to collect seeds from their favorite wild plants, planting them near their settlements and manipulating them, through breeding, to better suit their needs. Domestication led to the beginning of agriculture and to the plants we now call crops. What did corn look like when it was a wild grass called Teosinte? How did its appearance change once the ancient farmers began to breed it? (Use the “Edible Schoolyard: Teosinte to Corn Visual Aid Card” as a teaching tool) Teosinte: Rather than one long main stem, the plant was bushy with many branches and leaves. It had clusters of kernel-like seeds, but they were not organized onto a cob or surrounded by husk leaves. The teosinte kernels could drop off the plant onto the soil, allowing it to “self-seed”. Over thousands of years, ancestral farmers saved the seed from the teosinte plants that produced something like an ear of corn but these ears were short and skinny and had very few kernels attached to the cob. A Changing Appearance: Ancestral farmers collected seed from the teosinte plants that had: (a) shorter side branches and (b) a more distinct cob that had leaves, called husks and (c) husks that grew tight to the cob. Over time, some of these domesticated plants changed their appearance: taller with a larger main stalk fewer branches with several larger cobs attached kernels became larger and grew in long rows along the cob the cob became totally enclosed by husks Due to the husks, these plants could not drop their kernels to the ground to self-seed; they needed humans to harvest and plant the kernels. This means that wherever corn kernels or cobs are found, it is certain that the site was used by humans. Maize / Corn: Seed saving showed the ancestral farmers how to manipulate the 5 genes that control all the traits that make teosinte different from corn. For example, they learned they could change the gene that made the kernels hard, like popcorn (because kernels are enclosed in a hard fruit case). Farmers manipulated this gene and made the kernels more like the soft, exposed kernels we know and enjoy eating off the cob. This made corn much more edible. Teosinte still grows as a wild grass throughout Mexico. As teosinte changed, so did its name: it began being called “**maize“** in Spanish and”corn&quot; in English.

Briefly gather input from the students, while steering the discussion toward the answers listed below the question. A domesticated plant must be “cultivated”. What does this word mean? Planting seeds by hand, in a specially selected place, is called “cultivation.” Farmers collect and then cultivate seeds from the plants that: produce the most food have other talents, like being able to survive periods of drought (these talents are called desirable traits.) Even though many crops look different than their wild ancestors, in most cases their wild ancestors can still be found in nature, looking similar to their modern versions. However, the crop called corn is different: there is nothing in nature that looks like the corn plant that we know. Why did ancient farmers invent the practice of seed saving? Some plants perform better than others: they produce the best crops at harvest time even if the growing season has been challenging. Ancient farmers noticed that if they planted the seeds from the best performing plants, their harvest would likely be larger and more dependable. This process, called seed saving, was one way that ancient farmers contributed to the success of of their settlement and its future generations. How did the ancestral Pueblo farmers decide which corn plants to save seed from? Write the following categories on the whiteboard, allowing students to brainstorm why each of these traits matter. Ancient farmers, as well as modern farmers, look for corn plants that have “desirable traits” such as: Tolerance of harsh conditions: the ability to survive drought, wind, heat, altitude, floods and pests. Commercial seeds, developed in other parts of the country, often cannot adapt to the difficult local growing conditions on Hopi land. Kernel Color: a solid layer of black color at the pointy end of the kernel can signify that a seed is healthy and will germinate well. Hopi people also grow corn in order to produce kernels of certain colors that structure their religion and ceremonies. The purity of these kernel colors are important. Number and arrangement of seeds on each cob: long, tight lines of kernels, without gaps, are a better food source and are needed for ceremonial purposes. Time to maturity: the plant must be able to finish its life cycle and produce a cob within the number of frost-free days on Hopi land. Survival of long-term storage: the kernels must be hard, without soft spots, in order to store well throughout the winter, as a food source and as a reserve of seeds that will successfully germinate in the spring. For the Hopi culture, and many other cultures around the world, seed saving is part their survival (physical and cultural). The corn plant has been crucial for the survival of the Hopi people because it has provided essential food for thousands of years. How does a corn kernel provide food for humans? Use the diagram of a corn kernel showing the endosperm to support this discussion. Use the whiteboard to write the following key terms and review them with the students: Photosynthesis: a process used by plants, to make a sugary food that fuels its growth. Plants absorb the energy of the sun through their leaves, combine it with water and carbon dioxide, and make a sugar called glucose. Fun Fact: The waste product of this process creates is oxygen! Starch: plants store the glucose they’ve made by converting it into starch. When you eat a starchy plant material, like a corn kernel, you receive its energy. Endosperm: the plant stores its starch in this part of the seed. Carbohydrates: a food-based energy source. Starchy plant material, like corn, is high in carbohydrates. People like to use “carbs” as a food source because the starch breaks down into glucose sugar and provide us with energy over a long period of time. Glucose that is unused by the body is stored in the body as fat. Fun Facts: - Nearly 60% of all corn grown in the U.S.A. is fed to livestock. - One out of every four food products in our grocery stores has corn in it. Which of this products in this list do you believe DOES NOT use corn as an ingredient? Using the list of products that were written on the whiteboard in advance, conduct a survey of the students’ awareness of the vast array of products that use corn as an ingredient. Tally the votes next to the item voted for. After a minute or so, inform the students that ALL of these products are made with corn. Procedure Divide the class into working groups: “Corn Seed Saving Group” and “Corn Seed Dissection Group”. After approximately 30 minutes, rotate the groups. Corn Seed Saving Group Inform the students how they should organize their seed saving duties: One member of the pair should work on removing seeds from the cob; the other should gather a paper bag and marker, labelling the bag with: the name of the corn variety the origin of the corn seed/ where the corn was grown the date the seeds were gathered After one student has worked on removing seeds for a few minutes, the students should switch jobs: one removes seeds while the other student separate the kernels from pieces of husk and other plant material by sifting them using the colanders or pouring the kernels from one galvanized tub to the other. All cleaned kernels should be stored in the labelled paper bag. Give the students the following context and demonstration on harvesting Hopi corn seeds: Traditionally, Hopi people stored their corn seeds over the winter by leaving them on the cob and stacking the cobs, similar to how we might stack wood. The cobs are stacked indoors to make sure they remain dry and protected from rodents. In preparation for planting, the kernels are removed from the cob and grouped together by type and/or color. Each kernel is examined carefully for any damage or defect, and then distributed to the men for planting. We will harvest the corn seed from these cobs using the following method, traditionally used by the Hopi: Students should detach the dried kernels from the cobs by: Hold one cob, with kernels attached, over a bowl or tray so that seeds do not drop on the ground. Hold another cob at the wide/bottom end just above the stem attachment point (ideally this cob will already have its kernels removed; to avoid confusion, this cob will be referred to as “the cob tool”). Hold the cob tool at a 45 degree angle to a cob with the kernels still attached. Starting at the pointy/top of the cob, hit the kernels with the stem attachment point to dislodge the kernels into the bowl or tray. Continue doing this, working down the cob to create a row or strip of cob that is cleared of kernels from tip to bottom. Always hit/push the kernels toward the spaces that are empty of kernels. The thumb can also be used to push on and dislodge the kernels, but always push attached kernels toward the empty spaces left by removed kernels. As students work, they should examine the kernels for similarities and differences in structure and color that they can share with the group during Closing Circle. Once a small pile has accumulated, one student can gather kernels from the bowl or tray and begin separating the kernels from pieces of husk and other plant material: sift the kernels using the colanders or pour the kernels from one galvanized tub to the other, ideally where a cross wind can catch and blow away the plant materials. Traditionally, the Hopi used baskets loosely woven from strands of yucca leaves for this task, called a sifting basket. Examine and remove seeds that have any defects that may prevent them from germinating: Soft/moist spots on the seed coat Mold Seed coats that have been chewed or otherwise cut/crushed/damaged Place clean corn seed in paper bags and label with the variety/name of the corn, the date, and location where it was grown. Corn Seed Dissection Group Prepare for the dissection experiment as a class: ** Define the term “indicator”:** An indicator is a chemical used to help identify a substance. Many indicators work by producing a color change when they react with a certain substance. A solution of iodine and potassium iodide can be used as an indicator for the presence of a substance called “starch”. Observe the diagram: the embryo stores all the information about how the plant will look as it moves through its life cycle. This information is coded into the plant’s genes, which the ancestral farmers learned to manipulate to meet their needs: Diagram of a corn kernel showing the endosperm: http://media.web.britannica.com/eb-media/54/166754-050-8DEB8E13.jpg Observe a pre-dissected kernel: the pre-dissected kernel that has been treated with iodine will highlight the “endosperm”; this is the part of the kernel where starch is stored. Combine the solutions: - Dissolve 10 grams (0.35 ounces) of potassium iodide and 5 grams (0.18 ounces) of iodine in 100 milliliters (3.4 fluid ounces) of water. - the solution of iodine and potassium iodide should be passed around to student pairs once they have removed the tipcap and cut open their kernel: Students work independently on a dissection experiment: Distribute: paper plates, pre-soaked corn kernels, a hand lens and a plastic knife to the student pairs. Dissect: Each student should have their own pre-soaked kernel to identify anatomy and examine the endosperm: Using a fingernail, pull off the tipcap (pointy end) of the kernel. This makes the pericarp/seed coat loose and easy to pull off. Pull off as much as possible. 1. Then use the knife to cut the kernel in half, slicing down the narrow middle to create two wide halves. 1. Use a hand lens or microscope to examine the inside. 1. Add a solution of iodine and potassium iodide to test for the presence of starch: To test for starch, place a few drops of the mixture on each corn kernel dissected by students. The solution will change color in the presence of starch. Alert the students that the solutions can stain skin and clothes. Closing Circle Ancient farmers gave corn to the world. Now it is completely integrated into our modern life: it provides human food, animal food, and even fuel - corn is processed into an engine fuel called “ethanol.” We have these innovative ancient farmers to thank for all the ways in which corn has improved our lives. The Hopi people have shown that, if we take seed saving and stewardship of the land seriously, it is possible to protect sacred and productive varieties of corn for centuries. Report Back: Students from each group share outcomes and observations gained during their work group time, ensuring that the corn kernels have been properly labeled and stored in the paper bags. Tasting: Cut in half and compare 2 specimens of one vegetable or fruit. Ask the students to look at the size, shape, number of seeds and finally the taste. Ask which specimen they would pick to save seed from and why? Taste! Short Session 1 Short Session 1: Creating Colorful Corn Format: One approximately 45 minute session Opening Circle Read the following bolded text aloud: Agriculture is an important part of culture. The way that people organize themselves around their domesticated plants teaches us a lot about their culture’s traditions and customs. The Hopi culture, and its connection to the corn plant, is a good example of this. Listen to this quote that describes the spiritual importance of corn to the Hopi culture: **_&quot;Since the emergence, Hopis refer to this life as the fourth way. As the Hopi moved from the third to the fourth way of life, they were offered corn by Ma&#39;saw (the Guardian Spirit). The other peoples took the largest ears of corn and Hopis were left with the short blue ear. Each clan history explains how the Hopi received the short blue ear. The Hopis knew that their fourth way of life would be difficult and that they must submit to the corn as a way of life. The themes of humility, cooperation, respect, and universal earth stewardship became the way of life for all Hopis. In this way, the Hopi have always had corn and agriculture.&quot;_** &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt; (Kuwanwisiwma 2005:16) The Hopi recognize many different varieties of corn. Most of these varieties were domesticated on Hopi land; a few were brought into the culture from outside of Hopi land. The Hopi have saved seeds from their domesticated plants for centuries in order to develop corn varieties that have many different special characteristics and colors. Understanding the process of seed saving begins with understanding how domesticated plants can be used for “breeding”. Survey students’ understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the following questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students, while steering the discussion toward the answers listed below the question. How did the Hopi people use domestication to create their beautifully colored corn varieties? Corn is a grain; when we eat it, we are eating the grains of a grass plant. About 9,000 years ago, people from a region near Mexico City began domesticating a wild grass plant called Teosinte. By planting it again and again in their garden spaces, they learned that they could breed the plants, which means encouraging plants with special qualities to mix their pollen, thereby sharing their genes with one another. The ancient people of Mexico bred teosinte plants until they had totally transformed them from a wild plant into a food crop. This process domesticated Teosinte and transformed it into corn. Domesticated corn arrived in the American Southwest region approximately 4,000 years ago. The Hopi continued breeding corn to create kernels of many colors, deepening the ways that corn holds and communicates Hopi culture/spirituality. What change in human lifestyle led to the need to domesticate corn and other plants? About 10,000 years ago humans became less nomadic (moving their settlements seasonally) and became settled (living in one place for a long period of time). Soon after settling, humans saw that it would be no longer possible to only gather wild plants to eat from around their settlement. These wild food plants would soon be too heavily harvested and would not grow back quickly enough to provide food for the settlement. Humans began to collect seeds from their favorite wild plants, planting them near their settlements and manipulating them, through breeding, to better suit their needs. Domestication led to the beginning of agriculture and to the plants we now call crops. What did corn look like when it was a wild grass called Teosinte? How did its appearance change once the ancient farmers began to breed it? (Use the “Edible Schoolyard: Teosinte to Corn Visual Aid Card” as a teaching tool) Teosinte: Rather than one long main stem, the plant was bushy with many branches and leaves. It had clusters of kernel-like seeds, but they were not organized onto a cob or surrounded by husk leaves. The teosinte kernels could drop off the plant onto the soil, allowing it to “self-seed”. Over thousands of years, ancestral farmers saved the seed from the teosinte plants that produced something like an ear of corn but these ears were short and skinny and had very few kernels attached to the cob. A Changing Appearance: Ancestral farmers collected seed from the teosinte plants that had: (a) shorter side branches and (b) a more distinct cob that had leaves, called husks and (c) husks that grew tight to the cob. Over time, some of these domesticated plants changed their appearance: taller with a larger main stalk fewer branches with several larger cobs attached kernels became larger and grew in long rows along the cob the cob became totally enclosed by husks Due to the husks, these plants could not drop their kernels to the ground to self-seed; they needed humans to harvest and plant the kernels. This means that wherever corn kernels or cobs are found, it is certain that the site was used by humans. Maize / Corn: Seed saving showed the ancestral farmers how to manipulate the 5 genes that control all the traits that make teosinte different from corn. For example, they learned they could change the gene that made the kernels hard, like popcorn (because kernels are enclosed in a hard fruit case). Farmers manipulated this gene and made the kernels more like the soft, exposed kernels we know and enjoy eating off the cob. This made corn much more edible. Teosinte still grows as a wild grass throughout Mexico. As teosinte changed, so did its name: it began being called “**maize“** in Spanish and”corn&quot; in English. Procedure: Divide the class into pairs to work on “Corn Seed Dissecting”. Each pair will share a plastic knife but each student should have their own plate and pre-soaked kernel. Corn Seed Dissection Prepare for the dissection experiment as a class: ** Define the term “indicator”:** An indicator is a chemical used to help identify a substance.
