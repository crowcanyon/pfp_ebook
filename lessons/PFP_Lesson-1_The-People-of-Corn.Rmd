**Objectives**

-   Understand the relationship between Puebloan cultures, and
    agriculture.
-   Understand the connection between corn, agricultural practices and
    the culture it sustains.
-   Identify how Hopi farmers adapted their agricultural practices to
    become drought resilient.
-   Explore *sustainability* as a cultural trait.

#### Long Session {-}
***Long Session: Pueblo Lifeways and Sustainability***

**Format:** One approximately 90 minute session

***Opening Circle: Questions and Discussion***

Survey students' understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the
questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students,
while steering the discussion to toward the answers listed below the
question.

> **What is the definition of *self-sufficiency?***  
*A person or group that is self sufficient is able to provide
themselves with what is necessary with little help from others.
Examples: people living in a remote wilderness; people doing an
expedition into mountain or ocean environments; astronauts in space.*

> **What does the term "ancestral Pueblo people" mean?**  
*An ancient Native American culture that spanned the present-day Four
Corners region of the United States; the ancestors of today's Pueblo
tribes of Arizona and New Mexico. Ancestral Pueblo people were very
skilled at self sufficiency. Their material culture and their lifeways
reflect the innovations and adaptations they developed to survive in a
isolated and challenging desert environment. They were resilient.*

Show students a map of the United States, and help them to identify the
Four Corners region: Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.

Read the following portion of the Hopi creation story:

> ***After their Emergence into the Fourth World, the clans that would one
day comprise the Hopi people approached the Guardian Spirit, Ma'saw, in
the region that is now northwest Arizona and asked his permission to
settle there.... "Whether you can stay here is up to you," he told them.
Masaw warned the clan people that the life he had to offer them was very
different from what they had before. To show them that life, Ma'saw gave
the people a planting stick (So'ya), a bag of seeds and a gourd of
water. He handed them a small ear of blue corn and told them, "Here is
my life and spirit. This is what I give you."***  
-- <cite>(Wall and Masayesva 2004:435--436)</cite>


Introduce students to the corn varieties and explore their diversity
in size, color, endosperm texture (use a diagram of a corn kernel at
this time).

Show students the digging stick and gourd and circulate them, along
with the corn seed. Allow students to handle and observe them.

**Procedure:**

1.  Divide students into small discussion groups of 3 to 5 students and
    rearrange their seating so they are sitting in small discussion
    circles. Count-off the groups, from 1 to 3, to assign each of them a
    discussion question number. Read aloud each of the discussion
    questions to the corresponding groups.
2.  Each group should nominate and indicate to the instructor who will
    be their "Scribe": the person who will begin the discussion by
    rereading the discussion question to the group, and then record the
    group's answers, to share with the class. Hand out the correct
    discussion question sheet and a pen to each scribe.
3.  For a total of approximately 5 minutes, groups should discuss their
    discussion question and report back on their ideas.
4.  After about 2 minutes, give the groups a time-check and a reminder:
    scribes need to record at least a few complete sentence answers to
    share. At this time, scribes should re-read their discussion
    question to their group to ensure the discussion is still focused
    and relevant.
5.  Come back together as a group. The "scribe" from each group shares
    their group's ideas with the class.
6.  The instructor helps to *connect* the students' answers with the
    information presented below, to help them draw conclusions from
    their group's ideas.

**Question \#1:**

***Without direct instructions from the Guardian Spirit, Masaw, how did
the first Hopi farmers learn how to dryland farm in the southwest?***

Through years of trial and error, agricultural experiments, and
long-term observations, they became experts at:

-   Understanding plant and animal behavior
-   Knowing soil types and measuring moisture content
-   Predicting weather patterns
-   Predicting and directing water runoff

**Question \#2:**

***Why is corn, in particular, so important to every aspect of
traditional Hopi life?***  
***How is corn and agriculture viewed in our modern culture?** *

-   Corn farming in a drought prone environment is difficult. Helping
    corn plants to survive becomes a metaphor for how people can
    survive, as life is often difficult. Dryland corn farming teaches
    Hopi people the value of patience, humility, respect and
    cooperation.
-   Hopi and Ancestral Pueblo people grew food for their own survival.
    They knew exactly how their food was grown and where it came from.
-   Modern agriculture has disconnected many modern people from an
    awareness of where and how their food is grown or produced. Many
    modern people expect their food to be delivered to their towns and
    houses, already processed, preserved and packaged.
-   Many modern farmers view corn as a large scale cash crop; they know
    that, to produce most corn today, a large water supply (irrigation),
    fertilizers, and machinery are required.

**Question \#3:**

***After examining the different kinds of Hopi corn, why do you think
there are so many varieties of traditional corn? What are some of the
threats from GMO corn on Hopi corn?***

-   **Genes** provide the instructions to build a living thing. If you
    change one of the genes, you rewrite the instructions.
-   Humans have been manipulating the genes of plants for 10,000 years,
    without harming ecosystems or humans, in a process called
    **breeding**---mixing and matching the characteristics found within
    one species of plant. It has resulted in an increase in diversity in
    crop plants, benefiting human health and increasing the chance that
    communities will survive environmental challenges like drought.
-   **Diversity** is important when growing crops in challenging
    environments, such as the Hopi do. The Hopi people have survived on
    their land in part because they have bred over 17 different named
    varieties of corn, each with special talents for adapting and
    overcoming threats like drought, and excelling at essential skills
    like long-term storage.
-   **GMO**: this acronym stands for Genetically Modified Organism. They
    are created by mixing genes from very different species in order to
    meet a need or fix a problem in agriculture such as resisting
    disease and pests, surviving frost and drought.
-   The **difference** between genetically modifying plants and breeding
    them:
    -   *Breeding crops*: plant species' genes are changed over
        thousands of years
    -   *Genetically modifying crops*: plant species' genes are changed
        when a gene, sometimes from a non-plant species, is inserted
        to create a new species that has never before existed on Earth
        and arrives almost overnight without evolving alongside its
        environment.

-   It is hard to control or predict the mixing of genes plants. Once
    GMOs are involved, unintended consequences can result. The
    **impacts** of GMO seed on traditional crops and ecosystems are
    being actively studied by agricultural scientists. In the meantime,
    the Hopi must protect their corn's genes from mixing with
    genetically modified genes. They must protect the purity of the corn
    varieties that are at the center of their culture.

**With students remaining seated with their small discussion groups,
survey students' understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the
questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students,
while steering the discussion to toward the answers listed below the
question.**

1.  Introduce students to the term ***self-sufficiency*** by writing
    it on the whiteboard and reading it aloud. Have students work in
    small groups of three or four students to discuss the meaning of
    self-sufficiency. Invite each group to share with the class while
    guiding the discussion toward the the following definition: *A
    person or group that is self sufficient is able to provide
    themselves with what is necessary with little help from others.
    Examples: people living in a remote wilderness; people doing an
    expedition into mountain or ocean environments; astronauts in
    space.*

2.  Ask students the following questions and record their responses on
    the whiteboard:
    
    > ***How will humans achieve self sufficiency in the
    future? For example, how will we make sure we are able to feed the
    human population as it increases and the health of the planet
    decreases? ***
    
    Point out that being self sufficient on planet Earth
    requires that we:

    - know our history (how we have taken care of ourselves in the past)
    - carefully craft innovative solutions (how we will take care of
    ourselves in the future)
    

3.  Have students work in groups of three or four to engage in a
    discussion about each of the following questions. Present each
    question one at a time and allow no more than two minutes of
    discussion per question

    - ***Do you live in an isolated place? What would happen if the town
    you live in were cut off from receiving food from outside sources?
    How many roads lead to your hometown? ***
    - ***What kind of events could (or have in the past) destroyed or
    blocked these roads? ***
    Flash floods, mudslides, road construction dynamite, wildfires.
    - ***An important aspect of self sufficiency is food. How does your
    town stock the shelves of the grocery stores?***
    Food is delivered by transport trucks. Towns like Cortez could quickly
    become isolated from receiving food and materials from outside
    sources.
    - ***What does it mean to have "food security"? ***
    A community has "food security" when safe, nutritious food is
    available without people or food having to travel great distances.

Students return to working with their small discussion groups. Outline
the final activity:

1.  Each group will work as a team to make Space Travel Self-Sufficiency
    Plan based on the following hypothetical scenario (read aloud):

    > ***Healthy human life on Earth is no longer possible due to
    environmental damage. All humans will leave in fleets of spacecraft
    where they plan to live for 50 human generations or 1000 years. Each
    spaceship has a population of people that must act as a community. Each
    community is named after their ship. The first ship to leave will be
    "Discovery One". It will establish the "Discovery One" community. Each
    community must decide what what is essential to take with them from
    among the objects and technologies that currently exist.***

2.  Each student group will work together as a spacecraft community for
    15 minutes. Distribute to each a piece of chart paper and a marker.
    During this time, the instructor aids the groups by being a
    timekeeper. They must accomplish the following tasks to prepare for
    their escape from Earth:
    - Decide on a name for their ship/community (1 minute)
    - Decide which community member will be: (2 minutes)
        i. "The Scribe": a person with good handwriting and drawing
            skills and will draw, write and speak for the group, reading
            their plan aloud at the end.
        ii. "The Checker": a person who asks good questions and can
            focus the discussion on the most important questions about
            survival.

3.  Being guided by The Scribe and The Checker, the groups draw a large,
    basic outline of a spaceship that takes up most of the chart paper.
    The scribe fills the outline with words that describe items or
    technologies they want to bring. (5 minutes)

4.  At the halfway point in the groups' work time (approximately 8
    minutes into group work time), briefly regroup as a class, and give
    the students the following clarifications:
    -   6th grade: encourage students to focus on items that will create
        systems that resemble healthy ecosystems. Remind all groups
        that they cannot include any technology or inventions that
        have yet to be invented.
    -   7th & 8th grade: Review the concept that the water cycle is a
        closed system. Inform students that the items they bring
        should account for this and other closed systems, like
        trash/compost/waste, in their spacecraft. Remind all groups
        that they cannot include any technology or inventions that
        have yet to be invented.

Students resume planning and make changes to their spacecraft to account
for these ideas. (approximately 7 minutes).

**Closing Circle**

Invite each group to present their plan of self-sufficiency to the
class. Have any of the groups made the connection between their
spacecraft and the actual planet Earth we live on? Our spaceship is
called Planet Earth. Read the following statement:

> ***We are already living on a spacecraft; the Earth is spinning through
space holding human communities. We are separated from space by a thin
layer of atmosphere; the distance from the surface of the planet to
outer space is barely 60 miles. Earth is the only planet we know of that
sustains human life, despite searching space for 60 years.***

Explain to students that many ancient cultures throughout the world have
created agricultural practices that were sustainable and
self-sufficient. Point out that over the next couple of weeks students
will be learning about ancestral Pueblo people, their farming practices,
and how these practices can inform our own sustainable relationship to
the land.

Engage students in a brief discussion to address the following
questions:

> ***What does sustainability mean to you? Do the Hopi/Ancestral Pueblo
people meet your ideas of sustainability? Students explain their
opinions. Survey the students for their understanding of the following
quote:***

**"Indigenous education is really a ten thousand year strategic plan."**
-- <cite>Gregory Cajete</cite>

> ***There are 7.3 billion people riding along on spacecraft Planet Earth.
We must COMBINE our ancestral agriculture techniques,materials and
principles we relied on in the past WITH the innovative technologies and
materials of the future.***

Write on the whiteboard:

        have yet to be invented.
    -   7th & 8th grade: Review the concept that the water cycle is a
        closed system. Inform students that the items they bring
        should account for this and other closed systems, like
        trash/compost/waste, in their spacecraft. Remind all groups
        that they cannot include any technology or inventions that
        have yet to be invented.

Students resume planning and make changes to their spacecraft to account
for these ideas. (approximately 7 minutes).

**Closing Circle:**

Invite each group to present their plan of self-sufficiency to the
class. Have any of the groups made the connection between their
spacecraft and the actual planet Earth we live on? Our spaceship is
called Planet Earth. Read the following statement:

> ***We are already living on a spacecraft; the Earth is spinning through
space holding human communities. We are separated from space by a thin
layer of atmosphere; the distance from the surface of the planet to
outer space is barely 60 miles. Earth is the only planet we know of that
sustains human life, despite searching space for 60 years.***

Explain to students that many ancient cultures throughout the world have
created agricultural practices that were sustainable and
self-sufficient. Point out that over the next couple of weeks students
will be learning about ancestral Pueblo people, their farming practices,
and how these practices can inform our own sustainable relationship to
the land.

#### Short Session 2 {-}
***Short Session 2: The Pueblo Lifeways***

**Format:** One approximately 45 minute session

***Opening Circle: Questions and Discussion ***

Survey students' understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the
questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students,
while steering the discussion to toward the answers listed below the
question.

> **What is the definition of *self-sufficiency?***  
*A person or group that is self sufficient is able to provide
themselves with what is necessary with little help from others.
Examples: people living in a remote wilderness; people doing an
expedition into mountain or ocean environments; astronauts in space.*

> **What does the term "ancestral Pueblo people" mean?**  
*An ancient Native American culture that spanned the present-day Four
Corners region of the United States; the ancestors of today's Pueblo
tribes of Arizona and New Mexico. Ancestral Pueblo people were very
skilled at self sufficiency. Their material culture and their lifeways
reflect the innovations and adaptations they developed to survive in a
isolated and challenging desert environment. They were resilient.*

Show students a map of the United States, and help them to identify the
Four Corners region: Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.

Read the following portion of the Hopi creation story:

> ***After their Emergence into the Fourth World, the clans that would one
day comprise the Hopi people approached the Guardian Spirit, Ma'saw, in
the region that is now northwest Arizona and asked his permission to
settle there.... "Whether you can stay here is up to you," he told them.
Masaw warned the clan people that the life he had to offer them was very
different from what they had before. To show them that life, Ma'saw gave
the people a planting stick (So'ya), a bag of seeds and a gourd of
water. He handed them a small ear of blue corn and told them, "Here is
my life and spirit. This is what I give you."***  
-- <cite>(Wall and Masayesva 2004:435--436)</cite>


Introduce students to the corn varieties and explore their diversity
in size, color, endosperm texture (use a diagram of a corn kernel at
this time).

Show students the digging stick and gourd and circulate them, along
with the corn seed. Allow students to handle and observe them.

**Procedure:**

1.  Divide students into small discussion groups of 3 to 5 students and
    rearrange their seating so they are sitting in small discussion
    circles. Count-off the groups, from 1 to 3, to assign each of them a
    discussion question number. Read aloud each of the discussion
    questions to the corresponding groups.
2.  Each group should nominate and indicate to the instructor who will
    be their "Scribe": the person who will begin the discussion by
    rereading the discussion question to the group, and then record the
    group's answers, to share with the class. Hand out the correct
    discussion question sheet and a pen to each scribe.
3.  For a total of approximately 5 minutes, groups should discuss their
    discussion question and report back on their ideas.
4.  After about 2 minutes, give the groups a time-check and a reminder:
    scribes need to record at least a few complete sentence answers to
    share. At this time, scribes should re-read their discussion
    question to their group to ensure the discussion is still focused
    and relevant.
5.  Come back together as a group. The "scribe" from each group shares
    their group's ideas with the class.
6.  The instructor helps to *connect* the students' answers with the
    information presented below, to help them draw conclusions from
    their group's ideas.

**Question \#1:**

***Without direct instructions from the Guardian Spirit, Masaw, how did
the first Hopi farmers learn how to dryland farm in the southwest?***

Through years of trial and error, agricultural experiments, and
long-term observations, they became experts at:

-   Understanding plant and animal behavior
-   Knowing soil types and measuring moisture content
-   Predicting weather patterns
-   Predicting and directing water runoff

**Question \#2:**

***Why is corn, in particular, so important to every aspect of
traditional Hopi life?***  
***How is corn and agriculture viewed in our modern culture?** *

-   Corn farming in a drought prone environment is difficult. Helping
    corn plants to survive becomes a metaphor for how people can
    survive, as life is often difficult. Dryland corn farming teaches
    Hopi people the value of patience, humility, respect and
    cooperation.
-   Hopi and Ancestral Pueblo people grew food for their own survival.
    They knew exactly how their food was grown and where it came from.
-   Modern agriculture has disconnected many modern people from an
    awareness of where and how their food is grown or produced. Many
    modern people expect their food to be delivered to their towns and
    houses, already processed, preserved and packaged.
-   Many modern farmers view corn as a large scale cash crop; they know
    that, to produce most corn today, a large water supply (irrigation),
    fertilizers, and machinery are required.

**Question \#3:**

***After examining the different kinds of Hopi corn, why do you think
there are so many varieties of traditional corn? What are some of the
threats from GMO corn on Hopi corn?***

-   **Genes** provide the instructions to build a living thing. If you
    change one of the genes, you rewrite the instructions.
-   Humans have been manipulating the genes of plants for 10,000 years,
    without harming ecosystems or humans, in a process called
    **breeding**---mixing and matching the characteristics found within
    one species of plant. It has resulted in an increase in diversity in
    crop plants, benefiting human health and increasing the chance that
    communities will survive environmental challenges like drought.
-   **Diversity** is important when growing crops in challenging
    environments, such as the Hopi do. The Hopi people have survived on
    their land in part because they have bred over 17 different named
    varieties of corn, each with special talents for adapting and
    overcoming threats like drought, and excelling at essential skills
    like long-term storage.
-   **GMO**: this acronym stands for Genetically Modified Organism. They
    are created by mixing genes from very different species in order to
    meet a need or fix a problem in agriculture such as resisting
    disease and pests, surviving frost and drought.
-   The **difference** between genetically modifying plants and breeding
    them:
    -   *Breeding crops*: plant species' genes are changed over
        thousands of years
    -   *Genetically modifying crops*: plant species' genes are changed
        when a gene, sometimes from a non-plant species, is inserted
        to create a new species that has never before existed on Earth
        and arrives almost overnight without evolving alongside its
        environment.

-   It is hard to control or predict the mixing of genes plants. Once
    GMOs are involved, unintended consequences can result. The
    **impacts** of GMO seed on traditional crops and ecosystems are
    being actively studied by agricultural scientists. In the meantime,
    the Hopi must protect their corn's genes from mixing with
    genetically modified genes. They must protect the purity of the corn
    varieties that are at the center of their culture.

questions:

> ***What does sustainability mean to you? Do the Hopi/Ancestral Pueblo
people meet your ideas of sustainability? Students explain their
opinions. Survey the students for their understanding of the following
quote:***

**"Indigenous education is really a ten thousand year strategic plan."**
-- <cite>Gregory Cajete</cite>
