***Short Session 1: Sustainability Spaceship***  

**Format:** One approximately 45 minute session

***Opening Circle: Questions and Discussion***

Survey students' understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the
questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students,
while steering the discussion to toward the answers listed below the
question.

Introduce students to the term ***self-sufficiency*** by writing
    it on the whiteboard and reading it aloud. Have students work in
    small groups of three or four students to discuss the meaning of
    self-sufficiency. Invite each group to share with the class while
    guiding the discussion toward the the following definition: *A
    person or group that is self sufficient is able to provide
    themselves with what is necessary with little help from others.
    Examples: people living in a remote wilderness; people doing an
    expedition into mountain or ocean environments; astronauts in
    space.*

2.  Ask students the following questions and record their responses on
    the whiteboard:
    
    > ***How will humans achieve self sufficiency in the
    future? For example, how will we make sure we are able to feed the
    human population as it increases and the health of the planet
    decreases? ***
    
    Point out that being self sufficient on planet Earth
    requires that we:

    - know our history (how we have taken care of ourselves in the past)
    - carefully craft innovative solutions (how we will take care of
    ourselves in the future)
    

3.  Have students work in groups of three or four to engage in a
    discussion about each of the following questions. Present each
    question one at a time and allow no more than two minutes of
    discussion per question

    - ***Do you live in an isolated place? What would happen if the town
    you live in were cut off from receiving food from outside sources?
    How many roads lead to your hometown? ***
    - ***What kind of events could (or have in the past) destroyed or
    blocked these roads? ***
    Flash floods, mudslides, road construction dynamite, wildfires.
    - ***An important aspect of self sufficiency is food. How does your
    town stock the shelves of the grocery stores?***
    Food is delivered by transport trucks. Towns like Cortez could quickly
    become isolated from receiving food and materials from outside
    sources.
    - ***What does it mean to have "food security"? ***
    A community has "food security" when safe, nutritious food is
    available without people or food having to travel great distances.

**Procedure: **

Divide students into small discussion groups of 3 to 5 students and
rearrange their seating so they are sitting in small discussion
circles. Outline the activity:

1.  Each group will work as a team to make Space Travel Self-Sufficiency
    Plan based on the following hypothetical scenario (read aloud):

    > ***Healthy human life on Earth is no longer possible due to
    environmental damage. All humans will leave in fleets of spacecraft
    where they plan to live for 50 human generations or 1000 years. Each
    spaceship has a population of people that must act as a community. Each
    community is named after their ship. The first ship to leave will be
    "Discovery One". It will establish the "Discovery One" community. Each
    community must decide what what is essential to take with them from
    among the objects and technologies that currently exist.***

2.  Each student group will work together as a spacecraft community for
    15 minutes. Distribute to each a piece of chart paper and a marker.
    During this time, the instructor aids the groups by being a
    timekeeper. They must accomplish the following tasks to prepare for
    their escape from Earth:
    - Decide on a name for their ship/community (1 minute)
    - Decide which community member will be: (2 minutes)
        i. "The Scribe": a person with good handwriting and drawing
            skills and will draw, write and speak for the group, reading
            their plan aloud at the end.
        ii. "The Checker": a person who asks good questions and can
            focus the discussion on the most important questions about
            survival.

3.  Being guided by The Scribe and The Checker, the groups draw a large,
    basic outline of a spaceship that takes up most of the chart paper.
    The scribe fills the outline with words that describe items or
    technologies they want to bring. (5 minutes)

4.  At the halfway point in the groups' work time (approximately 8
    minutes into group work time), briefly regroup as a class, and give
    the students the following clarifications:
    -   6th grade: encourage students to focus on items that will create
        systems that resemble healthy ecosystems. Remind all groups
        that they cannot include any technology or inventions that
        have yet to be invented.
    -   7th & 8th grade: Review the concept that the water cycle is a
        closed system. Inform students that the items they bring
        should account for this and other closed systems, like
        trash/compost/waste, in their spacecraft. Remind all groups
        that they cannot include any technology or inventions that
        have yet to be invented.

Students resume planning and make changes to their spacecraft to account
for these ideas. (approximately 7 minutes).

**Closing Circle:**

Invite each group to present their plan of self-sufficiency to the
class. Have any of the groups made the connection between their
spacecraft and the actual planet Earth we live on? Our spaceship is
called Planet Earth. Read the following statement:

> ***We are already living on a spacecraft; the Earth is spinning through
space holding human communities. We are separated from space by a thin
layer of atmosphere; the distance from the surface of the planet to
outer space is barely 60 miles. Earth is the only planet we know of that
sustains human life, despite searching space for 60 years.***

Explain to students that many ancient cultures throughout the world have
created agricultural practices that were sustainable and
self-sufficient. Point out that over the next couple of weeks students
will be learning about ancestral Pueblo people, their farming practices,
and how these practices can inform our own sustainable relationship to
the land.
