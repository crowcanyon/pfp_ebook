***Short Session 2: The Pueblo Lifeways***

**Format:** One approximately 45 minute session

***Opening Circle: Questions and Discussion ***

Survey students' understanding and/or opinions by verbally sharing the
questions or text in italics. Briefly gather input from the students,
while steering the discussion to toward the answers listed below the
question.

> **What is the definition of *self-sufficiency?***  
*A person or group that is self sufficient is able to provide
themselves with what is necessary with little help from others.
Examples: people living in a remote wilderness; people doing an
expedition into mountain or ocean environments; astronauts in space.*

> **What does the term "ancestral Pueblo people" mean?**  
*An ancient Native American culture that spanned the present-day Four
Corners region of the United States; the ancestors of today's Pueblo
tribes of Arizona and New Mexico. Ancestral Pueblo people were very
skilled at self sufficiency. Their material culture and their lifeways
reflect the innovations and adaptations they developed to survive in a
isolated and challenging desert environment. They were resilient.*

Show students a map of the United States, and help them to identify the
Four Corners region: Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.

Read the following portion of the Hopi creation story:

> ***After their Emergence into the Fourth World, the clans that would one
day comprise the Hopi people approached the Guardian Spirit, Ma'saw, in
the region that is now northwest Arizona and asked his permission to
settle there.... "Whether you can stay here is up to you," he told them.
Masaw warned the clan people that the life he had to offer them was very
different from what they had before. To show them that life, Ma'saw gave
the people a planting stick (So'ya), a bag of seeds and a gourd of
water. He handed them a small ear of blue corn and told them, "Here is
my life and spirit. This is what I give you."***  
-- <cite>(Wall and Masayesva 2004:435--436)</cite>


Introduce students to the corn varieties and explore their diversity
in size, color, endosperm texture (use a diagram of a corn kernel at
this time).

Show students the digging stick and gourd and circulate them, along
with the corn seed. Allow students to handle and observe them.

**Procedure:**

1.  Divide students into small discussion groups of 3 to 5 students and
    rearrange their seating so they are sitting in small discussion
    circles. Count-off the groups, from 1 to 3, to assign each of them a
    discussion question number. Read aloud each of the discussion
    questions to the corresponding groups.
2.  Each group should nominate and indicate to the instructor who will
    be their "Scribe": the person who will begin the discussion by
    rereading the discussion question to the group, and then record the
    group's answers, to share with the class. Hand out the correct
    discussion question sheet and a pen to each scribe.
3.  For a total of approximately 5 minutes, groups should discuss their
    discussion question and report back on their ideas.
4.  After about 2 minutes, give the groups a time-check and a reminder:
    scribes need to record at least a few complete sentence answers to
    share. At this time, scribes should re-read their discussion
    question to their group to ensure the discussion is still focused
    and relevant.
5.  Come back together as a group. The "scribe" from each group shares
    their group's ideas with the class.
6.  The instructor helps to *connect* the students' answers with the
    information presented below, to help them draw conclusions from
    their group's ideas.

**Question \#1:**

***Without direct instructions from the Guardian Spirit, Masaw, how did
the first Hopi farmers learn how to dryland farm in the southwest?***

Through years of trial and error, agricultural experiments, and
long-term observations, they became experts at:

-   Understanding plant and animal behavior
-   Knowing soil types and measuring moisture content
-   Predicting weather patterns
-   Predicting and directing water runoff

**Question \#2:**

***Why is corn, in particular, so important to every aspect of
traditional Hopi life?***  
***How is corn and agriculture viewed in our modern culture?** *

-   Corn farming in a drought prone environment is difficult. Helping
    corn plants to survive becomes a metaphor for how people can
    survive, as life is often difficult. Dryland corn farming teaches
    Hopi people the value of patience, humility, respect and
    cooperation.
-   Hopi and Ancestral Pueblo people grew food for their own survival.
    They knew exactly how their food was grown and where it came from.
-   Modern agriculture has disconnected many modern people from an
    awareness of where and how their food is grown or produced. Many
    modern people expect their food to be delivered to their towns and
    houses, already processed, preserved and packaged.
-   Many modern farmers view corn as a large scale cash crop; they know
    that, to produce most corn today, a large water supply (irrigation),
    fertilizers, and machinery are required.

**Question \#3:**

***After examining the different kinds of Hopi corn, why do you think
there are so many varieties of traditional corn? What are some of the
threats from GMO corn on Hopi corn?***

-   **Genes** provide the instructions to build a living thing. If you
    change one of the genes, you rewrite the instructions.
-   Humans have been manipulating the genes of plants for 10,000 years,
    without harming ecosystems or humans, in a process called
    **breeding**---mixing and matching the characteristics found within
    one species of plant. It has resulted in an increase in diversity in
    crop plants, benefiting human health and increasing the chance that
    communities will survive environmental challenges like drought.
-   **Diversity** is important when growing crops in challenging
    environments, such as the Hopi do. The Hopi people have survived on
    their land in part because they have bred over 17 different named
    varieties of corn, each with special talents for adapting and
    overcoming threats like drought, and excelling at essential skills
    like long-term storage.
-   **GMO**: this acronym stands for Genetically Modified Organism. They
    are created by mixing genes from very different species in order to
    meet a need or fix a problem in agriculture such as resisting
    disease and pests, surviving frost and drought.
-   The **difference** between genetically modifying plants and breeding
    them:
    -   *Breeding crops*: plant species' genes are changed over
        thousands of years
    -   *Genetically modifying crops*: plant species' genes are changed
        when a gene, sometimes from a non-plant species, is inserted
        to create a new species that has never before existed on Earth
        and arrives almost overnight without evolving alongside its
        environment.

-   It is hard to control or predict the mixing of genes plants. Once
    GMOs are involved, unintended consequences can result. The
    **impacts** of GMO seed on traditional crops and ecosystems are
    being actively studied by agricultural scientists. In the meantime,
    the Hopi must protect their corn's genes from mixing with
    genetically modified genes. They must protect the purity of the corn
    varieties that are at the center of their culture.

***Closing Circle: (5 minutes)***

Engage students in a brief discussion to address the following
questions:

> ***What does sustainability mean to you? Do the Hopi/Ancestral Pueblo
people meet your ideas of sustainability? Students explain their
opinions. Survey the students for their understanding of the following
