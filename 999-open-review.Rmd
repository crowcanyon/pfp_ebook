# Open Review {-}

Open Review means that you can freely read the book and easily help to make it better. You can offer suggestions by make annotations using [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/), an open source annotation system. This is a very simple system for interacting with the book. In addition to these feedback options, this website for the book will be collecting your implicit feedback by tracking the readership and abandonment rate of each section of the book.

The concept of Open Review, as it is implemented here, is taken from [Matthew Salganik's](https://twitter.com/msalganik) [Open Review Toolkit](http://www.openreviewtoolkit.org/). Much of the text on this page comes from the [Open Review Toolkit About page](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/open-review/) and the [Open Review Toolkit Privacy and Consent page](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/privacy/)

## FAQ about open review {-}

### What kind of feedback are you looking for? {-}

Open Review is not just about catching typos. Rather, Open Review is designed to collect all types of feedback, and we'd particularly welcome any feedback that you have about the substance of the book. Are there sections that you find particularly confusing? Are their points that you find particularly important? Are we making claims that you think need to be refined? Are there parts of the book that you think should be removed? When in doubt, we think you should follow one of the main principles at Wikipedia: [Be bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold).

### Can I see the annotations that others are making? {-}

Yes, all the annotations are public. You can see them on right hand side of the each page.

### What are the benefits for readers? {-}

You get to read the manuscript and help make it better.

### What are the benefits for authors and publishers? {-}

The Open Review process will benefit both authors and publishers, even if they have no interest in increasing access to knowledge. The process will lead to higher manuscript quality through the explicit and implicit feedback. Further, the Open Review process will provide valuable data that can be used during that marketing of the book.

### Has anyone ever done something like this before? {-}

This is based on [Matthew Salganik's](https://twitter.com/msalganik) [Open Review Toolkit](http://www.openreviewtoolkit.org/). He's written about some related efforts here: <http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/open-review/>
